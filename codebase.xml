		ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
		
		CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
		
		## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
		
		```yaml
		IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
		  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
		  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
		  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
		  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
		  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
		REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
		activation-instructions:

		  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
		  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
		  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
		  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
		  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
		  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
		  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
		  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute

		# /advanced-elicitation Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Advanced Elicitation Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
		- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
		- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives
		- Usable during template-driven document creation or any chat conversation
		
		## Usage Scenarios
		
		### Scenario 1: Template Document Creation
		
		After outputting a section during document creation:
		
		1. **Section Review**: Ask user to review the drafted section
		2. **Offer Elicitation**: Present 9 carefully selected elicitation methods
		3. **Simple Selection**: User types a number (0-8) to engage method, or 9 to proceed
		4. **Execute & Loop**: Apply selected method, then re-offer choices until user proceeds
		
		### Scenario 2: General Chat Elicitation
		
		User can request advanced elicitation on any agent output:
		
		- User says "do advanced elicitation" or similar
		- Agent selects 9 relevant methods for the context
		- Same simple 0-9 selection process
		
		## Task Instructions
		
		### 1. Intelligent Method Selection
		
		**Context Analysis**: Before presenting options, analyze:
		
		- **Content Type**: Technical specs, user stories, architecture, requirements, etc.
		- **Complexity Level**: Simple, moderate, or complex content
		- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who will use this information
		- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions vs routine items
		- **Creative Potential**: Opportunities for innovation or alternatives
		
		**Method Selection Strategy**:
		
		1. **Always Include Core Methods** (choose 3-4):
		   - Expand or Contract for Audience
		   - Critique and Refine
		   - Identify Potential Risks
		   - Assess Alignment with Goals
		
		2. **Context-Specific Methods** (choose 4-5):
		   - **Technical Content**: Tree of Thoughts, ReWOO, Meta-Prompting
		   - **User-Facing Content**: Agile Team Perspective, Stakeholder Roundtable
		   - **Creative Content**: Innovation Tournament, Escape Room Challenge
		   - **Strategic Content**: Red Team vs Blue Team, Hindsight Reflection
		
		3. **Always Include**: "Proceed / No Further Actions" as option 9
		
		### 2. Section Context and Review
		
		When invoked after outputting a section:
		
		1. **Provide Context Summary**: Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented
		
		2. **Explain Visual Elements**: If the section contains diagrams, explain them briefly before offering elicitation options
		
		3. **Clarify Scope Options**: If the section contains multiple distinct items, inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
		   - The entire section as a whole
		   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)
		
		### 3. Present Elicitation Options
		
		**Review Request Process:**
		
		- Ask the user to review the drafted section
		- In the SAME message, inform them they can suggest direct changes OR select an elicitation method
		- Present 9 intelligently selected methods (0-8) plus "Proceed" (9)
		- Keep descriptions short - just the method name
		- Await simple numeric selection
		
		**Action List Presentation Format:**
		
		```text
		**Advanced Elicitation Options**
		Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:
		
		0. [Method Name]
		1. [Method Name]
		2. [Method Name]
		3. [Method Name]
		4. [Method Name]
		5. [Method Name]
		6. [Method Name]
		7. [Method Name]
		8. [Method Name]
		9. Proceed / No Further Actions
		```
		
		**Response Handling:**
		
		- **Numbers 0-8**: Execute the selected method, then re-offer the choice
		- **Number 9**: Proceed to next section or continue conversation
		- **Direct Feedback**: Apply user's suggested changes and continue
		
		### 4. Method Execution Framework
		
		**Execution Process:**
		
		1. **Retrieve Method**: Access the specific elicitation method from the elicitation-methods data file
		2. **Apply Context**: Execute the method from your current role's perspective
		3. **Provide Results**: Deliver insights, critiques, or alternatives relevant to the content
		4. **Re-offer Choice**: Present the same 9 options again until user selects 9 or gives direct feedback
		
		**Execution Guidelines:**
		
		- **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy explanations
		- **Stay Relevant**: Tie all elicitation back to the specific content being analyzed
		- **Identify Personas**: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify which viewpoint is speaking
		- **Maintain Flow**: Keep the process moving efficiently]]></file>

		# /apply-qa-fixes Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# apply-qa-fixes
		
		Implement fixes based on QA results (gate and assessments) for a specific story. This task is for the Dev agent to systematically consume QA outputs and apply code/test changes while only updating allowed sections in the story file.
		
		## Purpose
		
		- Read QA outputs for a story (gate YAML + assessment markdowns)
		- Create a prioritized, deterministic fix plan
		- Apply code and test changes to close gaps and address issues
		- Update only the allowed story sections for the Dev agent
		
		## Inputs
		
		```yaml
		required:
		  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "2.2"
		  - qa_root: from `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` key `qa.qaLocation` (e.g., `docs/project/qa`)
		  - story_root: from `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` key `devStoryLocation` (e.g., `docs/project/stories`)
		
		optional:
		  - story_title: '{title}' # derive from story H1 if missing
		  - story_slug: '{slug}' # derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated) if missing
		```
		
		## QA Sources to Read
		
		- Gate (YAML): `{qa_root}/gates/{epic}.{story}-*.yml`
		  - If multiple, use the most recent by modified time
		- Assessments (Markdown):
		  - Test Design: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-test-design-*.md`
		  - Traceability: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-*.md`
		  - Risk Profile: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-*.md`
		  - NFR Assessment: `{qa_root}/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-*.md`
		
		## Prerequisites
		
		- Repository builds and tests run locally (Deno 2)
		- Lint and test commands available:
		  - `deno lint`
		  - `deno test -A`
		
		## Process (Do not skip steps)
		
		### 0) Load Core Config & Locate Story
		
		- Read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` and resolve `qa_root` and `story_root`
		- Locate story file in `{story_root}/{epic}.{story}.*.md`
		  - HALT if missing and ask for correct story id/path
		
		### 1) Collect QA Findings
		
		- Parse the latest gate YAML:
		  - `gate` (PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED)
		  - `top_issues[]` with `id`, `severity`, `finding`, `suggested_action`
		  - `nfr_validation.*.status` and notes
		  - `trace` coverage summary/gaps
		  - `test_design.coverage_gaps[]`
		  - `risk_summary.recommendations.must_fix[]` (if present)
		- Read any present assessment markdowns and extract explicit gaps/recommendations
		
		### 2) Build Deterministic Fix Plan (Priority Order)
		
		Apply in order, highest priority first:
		
		1. High severity items in `top_issues` (security/perf/reliability/maintainability)
		2. NFR statuses: all FAIL must be fixed → then CONCERNS
		3. Test Design `coverage_gaps` (prioritize P0 scenarios if specified)
		4. Trace uncovered requirements (AC-level)
		5. Risk `must_fix` recommendations
		6. Medium severity issues, then low
		
		Guidance:
		
		- Prefer tests closing coverage gaps before/with code changes
		- Keep changes minimal and targeted; follow project architecture and TS/Deno rules
		
		### 3) Apply Changes
		
		- Implement code fixes per plan
		- Add missing tests to close coverage gaps (unit first; integration where required by AC)
		- Keep imports centralized via `deps.ts` (see `docs/project/typescript-rules.md`)
		- Follow DI boundaries in `src/core/di.ts` and existing patterns
		
		### 4) Validate
		
		- Run `deno lint` and fix issues
		- Run `deno test -A` until all tests pass
		- Iterate until clean
		
		### 5) Update Story (Allowed Sections ONLY)
		
		CRITICAL: Dev agent is ONLY authorized to update these sections of the story file. Do not modify any other sections (e.g., QA Results, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Testing):
		
		- Tasks / Subtasks Checkboxes (mark any fix subtask you added as done)
		- Dev Agent Record →
		  - Agent Model Used (if changed)
		  - Debug Log References (commands/results, e.g., lint/tests)
		  - Completion Notes List (what changed, why, how)
		  - File List (all added/modified/deleted files)
		- Change Log (new dated entry describing applied fixes)
		- Status (see Rule below)
		
		Status Rule:
		
		- If gate was PASS and all identified gaps are closed → set `Status: Ready for Done`
		- Otherwise → set `Status: Ready for Review` and notify QA to re-run the review
		
		### 6) Do NOT Edit Gate Files
		
		- Dev does not modify gate YAML. If fixes address issues, request QA to re-run `review-story` to update the gate
		
		## Blocking Conditions
		
		- Missing `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
		- Story file not found for `story_id`
		- No QA artifacts found (neither gate nor assessments)
		  - HALT and request QA to generate at least a gate file (or proceed only with clear developer-provided fix list)
		
		## Completion Checklist
		
		- deno lint: 0 problems
		- deno test -A: all tests pass
		- All high severity `top_issues` addressed
		- NFR FAIL → resolved; CONCERNS minimized or documented
		- Coverage gaps closed or explicitly documented with rationale
		- Story updated (allowed sections only) including File List and Change Log
		- Status set according to Status Rule
		
		## Example: Story 2.2
		
		Given gate `docs/project/qa/gates/2.2-*.yml` shows
		
		- `coverage_gaps`: Back action behavior untested (AC2)
		- `coverage_gaps`: Centralized dependencies enforcement untested (AC4)
		
		Fix plan:
		
		- Add a test ensuring the Toolkit Menu "Back" action returns to Main Menu
		- Add a static test verifying imports for service/view go through `deps.ts`
		- Re-run lint/tests and update Dev Agent Record + File List accordingly
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- Deterministic, risk-first prioritization
		- Minimal, maintainable changes
		- Tests validate behavior and close gaps
		- Strict adherence to allowed story update areas
		- Gate ownership remains with QA; Dev signals readiness via Status]]></file>

	<file path='.claude\commands\BMad\tasks\correct-course.md'><![CDATA[
		# /correct-course Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Correct Course Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		- Guide a structured response to a change trigger using the `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.
		- Analyze the impacts of the change on epics, project artifacts, and the MVP, guided by the checklist's structure.
		- Explore potential solutions (e.g., adjust scope, rollback elements, re-scope features) as prompted by the checklist.
		- Draft specific, actionable proposed updates to any affected project artifacts (e.g., epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document sections) based on the analysis.
		- Produce a consolidated "Sprint Change Proposal" document that contains the impact analysis and the clearly drafted proposed edits for user review and approval.
		- Ensure a clear handoff path if the nature of the changes necessitates fundamental replanning by other core agents (like PM or Architect).
		
		## Instructions
		
		### 1. Initial Setup & Mode Selection
		
		- **Acknowledge Task & Inputs:**
		  - Confirm with the user that the "Correct Course Task" (Change Navigation & Integration) is being initiated.
		  - Verify the change trigger and ensure you have the user's initial explanation of the issue and its perceived impact.
		  - Confirm access to all relevant project artifacts (e.g., PRD, Epics/Stories, Architecture Documents, UI/UX Specifications) and, critically, the `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.
		- **Establish Interaction Mode:**
		  - Ask the user their preferred interaction mode for this task:
		    - **"Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** Shall we work through the change-checklist section by section, discussing findings and collaboratively drafting proposed changes for each relevant part before moving to the next? This allows for detailed, step-by-step refinement."
		    - **"YOLO Mode (Batch Processing):** Or, would you prefer I conduct a more batched analysis based on the checklist and then present a consolidated set of findings and proposed changes for a broader review? This can be quicker for initial assessment but might require more extensive review of the combined proposals."
		  - Once the user chooses, confirm the selected mode and then inform the user: "We will now use the change-checklist to analyze the change and draft proposed updates. I will guide you through the checklist items based on our chosen interaction mode."
		
		### 2. Execute Checklist Analysis (Iteratively or Batched, per Interaction Mode)
		
		- Systematically work through Sections 1-4 of the change-checklist (typically covering Change Context, Epic/Story Impact Analysis, Artifact Conflict Resolution, and Path Evaluation/Recommendation).
		- For each checklist item or logical group of items (depending on interaction mode):
		  - Present the relevant prompt(s) or considerations from the checklist to the user.
		  - Request necessary information and actively analyze the relevant project artifacts (PRD, epics, architecture documents, story history, etc.) to assess the impact.
		  - Discuss your findings for each item with the user.
		  - Record the status of each checklist item (e.g., `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Further Action Needed`) and any pertinent notes or decisions.
		  - Collaboratively agree on the "Recommended Path Forward" as prompted by Section 4 of the checklist.
		
		### 3. Draft Proposed Changes (Iteratively or Batched)
		
		- Based on the completed checklist analysis (Sections 1-4) and the agreed "Recommended Path Forward" (excluding scenarios requiring fundamental replans that would necessitate immediate handoff to PM/Architect):
		  - Identify the specific project artifacts that require updates (e.g., specific epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document components, diagrams).
		  - **Draft the proposed changes directly and explicitly for each identified artifact.** Examples include:
		    - Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority.
		    - Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting user stories within epics.
		    - Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets (e.g., providing an updated Mermaid diagram block or a clear textual description of the change to an existing diagram).
		    - Updating technology lists, configuration details, or specific sections within the PRD or architecture documents.
		    - Drafting new, small supporting artifacts if necessary (e.g., a brief addendum for a specific decision).
		  - If in "Incremental Mode," discuss and refine these proposed edits for each artifact or small group of related artifacts with the user as they are drafted.
		  - If in "YOLO Mode," compile all drafted edits for presentation in the next step.
		
		### 4. Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits
		
		- Synthesize the complete change-checklist analysis (covering findings from Sections 1-4) and all the agreed-upon proposed edits (from Instruction 3) into a single document titled "Sprint Change Proposal." This proposal should align with the structure suggested by Section 5 of the change-checklist.
		- The proposal must clearly present:
		  - **Analysis Summary:** A concise overview of the original issue, its analyzed impact (on epics, artifacts, MVP scope), and the rationale for the chosen path forward.
		  - **Specific Proposed Edits:** For each affected artifact, clearly show or describe the exact changes (e.g., "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]", "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]", "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]").
		- Present the complete draft of the "Sprint Change Proposal" to the user for final review and feedback. Incorporate any final adjustments requested by the user.
		
		### 5. Finalize & Determine Next Steps
		
		- Obtain explicit user approval for the "Sprint Change Proposal," including all the specific edits documented within it.
		- Provide the finalized "Sprint Change Proposal" document to the user.
		- **Based on the nature of the approved changes:**
		  - **If the approved edits sufficiently address the change and can be implemented directly or organized by a PO/SM:** State that the "Correct Course Task" is complete regarding analysis and change proposal, and the user can now proceed with implementing or logging these changes (e.g., updating actual project documents, backlog items). Suggest handoff to a PO/SM agent for backlog organization if appropriate.
		  - **If the analysis and proposed path (as per checklist Section 4 and potentially Section 6) indicate that the change requires a more fundamental replan (e.g., significant scope change, major architectural rework):** Clearly state this conclusion. Advise the user that the next step involves engaging the primary PM or Architect agents, using the "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for that deeper replanning effort.
		
		## Output Deliverables
		
		- **Primary:** A "Sprint Change Proposal" document (in markdown format). This document will contain:
		  - A summary of the change-checklist analysis (issue, impact, rationale for the chosen path).
		  - Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected project artifacts.
		- **Implicit:** An annotated change-checklist (or the record of its completion) reflecting the discussions, findings, and decisions made during the process.]]></file>

		# /create-brownfield-story Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Create Brownfield Story Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		Create detailed, implementation-ready stories for brownfield projects where traditional sharded PRD/architecture documents may not exist. This task bridges the gap between various documentation formats (document-project output, brownfield PRDs, epics, or user documentation) and executable stories for the Dev agent.
		
		## When to Use This Task
		
		**Use this task when:**
		
		- Working on brownfield projects with non-standard documentation
		- Stories need to be created from document-project output
		- Working from brownfield epics without full PRD/architecture
		- Existing project documentation doesn't follow BMad v4+ structure
		- Need to gather additional context from user during story creation
		
		**Use create-next-story when:**
		
		- Working with properly sharded PRD and v4 architecture documents
		- Following standard greenfield or well-documented brownfield workflow
		- All technical context is available in structured format
		
		## Task Execution Instructions
		
		### 0. Documentation Context
		
		Check for available documentation in this order:
		
		1. **Sharded PRD/Architecture** (docs/prd/, docs/architecture/)
		   - If found, recommend using create-next-story task instead
		
		2. **Brownfield Architecture Document** (docs/brownfield-architecture.md or similar)
		   - Created by document-project task
		   - Contains actual system state, technical debt, workarounds
		
		3. **Brownfield PRD** (docs/prd.md)
		   - May contain embedded technical details
		
		4. **Epic Files** (docs/epics/ or similar)
		   - Created by brownfield-create-epic task
		
		5. **User-Provided Documentation**
		   - Ask user to specify location and format
		
		### 1. Story Identification and Context Gathering
		
		#### 1.1 Identify Story Source
		
		Based on available documentation:
		
		- **From Brownfield PRD**: Extract stories from epic sections
		- **From Epic Files**: Read epic definition and story list
		- **From User Direction**: Ask user which specific enhancement to implement
		- **No Clear Source**: Work with user to define the story scope
		
		#### 1.2 Gather Essential Context
		
		CRITICAL: For brownfield stories, you MUST gather enough context for safe implementation. Be prepared to ask the user for missing information.
		
		**Required Information Checklist:**
		
		- [ ] What existing functionality might be affected?
		- [ ] What are the integration points with current code?
		- [ ] What patterns should be followed (with examples)?
		- [ ] What technical constraints exist?
		- [ ] Are there any "gotchas" or workarounds to know about?
		
		If any required information is missing, list the missing information and ask the user to provide it.
		
		### 2. Extract Technical Context from Available Sources
		
		#### 2.1 From Document-Project Output
		
		If using brownfield-architecture.md from document-project:
		
		- **Technical Debt Section**: Note any workarounds affecting this story
		- **Key Files Section**: Identify files that will need modification
		- **Integration Points**: Find existing integration patterns
		- **Known Issues**: Check if story touches problematic areas
		- **Actual Tech Stack**: Verify versions and constraints
		
		#### 2.2 From Brownfield PRD
		
		If using brownfield PRD:
		
		- **Technical Constraints Section**: Extract all relevant constraints
		- **Integration Requirements**: Note compatibility requirements
		- **Code Organization**: Follow specified patterns
		- **Risk Assessment**: Understand potential impacts
		
		#### 2.3 From User Documentation
		
		Ask the user to help identify:
		
		- Relevant technical specifications
		- Existing code examples to follow
		- Integration requirements
		- Testing approaches used in the project
		
		### 3. Story Creation with Progressive Detail Gathering
		
		#### 3.1 Create Initial Story Structure
		
		Start with the story template, filling in what's known:
		
		```markdown
		# Story {{Enhancement Title}}
		
		## Status: Draft
		
		## Story
		
		As a {{user_type}},
		I want {{enhancement_capability}},
		so that {{value_delivered}}.
		
		## Context Source
		
		- Source Document: {{document name/type}}
		- Enhancement Type: {{single feature/bug fix/integration/etc}}
		- Existing System Impact: {{brief assessment}}
		```
		
		#### 3.2 Develop Acceptance Criteria
		
		Critical: For brownfield, ALWAYS include criteria about maintaining existing functionality
		
		Standard structure:
		
		1. New functionality works as specified
		2. Existing {{affected feature}} continues to work unchanged
		3. Integration with {{existing system}} maintains current behavior
		4. No regression in {{related area}}
		5. Performance remains within acceptable bounds
		
		#### 3.3 Gather Technical Guidance
		
		Critical: This is where you'll need to be interactive with the user if information is missing
		
		Create Dev Technical Guidance section with available information:
		
		````markdown
		## Dev Technical Guidance
		
		### Existing System Context
		
		[Extract from available documentation]
		
		### Integration Approach
		
		[Based on patterns found or ask user]
		
		### Technical Constraints
		
		[From documentation or user input]
		
		### Missing Information
		
		Critical: List anything you couldn't find that dev will need and ask for the missing information
		
		### 4. Task Generation with Safety Checks
		
		#### 4.1 Generate Implementation Tasks
		
		Based on gathered context, create tasks that:
		
		- Include exploration tasks if system understanding is incomplete
		- Add verification tasks for existing functionality
		- Include rollback considerations
		- Reference specific files/patterns when known
		
		Example task structure for brownfield:
		
		```markdown
		## Tasks / Subtasks
		
		- [ ] Task 1: Analyze existing {{component/feature}} implementation
		  - [ ] Review {{specific files}} for current patterns
		  - [ ] Document integration points
		  - [ ] Identify potential impacts
		
		- [ ] Task 2: Implement {{new functionality}}
		  - [ ] Follow pattern from {{example file}}
		  - [ ] Integrate with {{existing component}}
		  - [ ] Maintain compatibility with {{constraint}}
		
		- [ ] Task 3: Verify existing functionality
		  - [ ] Test {{existing feature 1}} still works
		  - [ ] Verify {{integration point}} behavior unchanged
		  - [ ] Check performance impact
		
		- [ ] Task 4: Add tests
		  - [ ] Unit tests following {{project test pattern}}
		  - [ ] Integration test for {{integration point}}
		  - [ ] Update existing tests if needed
		```
		````
		
		### 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
		
		CRITICAL: for brownfield - always include risk assessment
		
		Add section for brownfield-specific risks:
		
		```markdown
		## Risk Assessment
		
		### Implementation Risks
		
		- **Primary Risk**: {{main risk to existing system}}
		- **Mitigation**: {{how to address}}
		- **Verification**: {{how to confirm safety}}
		
		### Rollback Plan
		
		- {{Simple steps to undo changes if needed}}
		
		### Safety Checks
		
		- [ ] Existing {{feature}} tested before changes
		- [ ] Changes can be feature-flagged or isolated
		- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
		```
		
		### 6. Final Story Validation
		
		Before finalizing:
		
		1. **Completeness Check**:
		   - [ ] Story has clear scope and acceptance criteria
		   - [ ] Technical context is sufficient for implementation
		   - [ ] Integration approach is defined
		   - [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation
		
		2. **Safety Check**:
		   - [ ] Existing functionality protection included
		   - [ ] Rollback plan is feasible
		   - [ ] Testing covers both new and existing features
		
		3. **Information Gaps**:
		   - [ ] All critical missing information gathered from user
		   - [ ] Remaining unknowns documented for dev agent
		   - [ ] Exploration tasks added where needed
		
		### 7. Story Output Format
		
		Save the story with appropriate naming:
		
		- If from epic: `docs/stories/epic-{n}-story-{m}.md`
		- If standalone: `docs/stories/brownfield-{feature-name}.md`
		- If sequential: Follow existing story numbering
		
		Include header noting documentation context:
		
		```markdown
		# Story: {{Title}}
		
		<!-- Source: {{documentation type used}} -->
		<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to {{existing system}} -->
		
		## Status: Draft
		
		[Rest of story content...]
		```
		
		### 8. Handoff Communication
		
		Provide clear handoff to the user:
		
		```text
		Brownfield story created: {{story title}}
		
		Source Documentation: {{what was used}}
		Story Location: {{file path}}
		
		Key Integration Points Identified:
		- {{integration point 1}}
		- {{integration point 2}}
		
		Risks Noted:
		- {{primary risk}}
		
		{{If missing info}}:
		Note: Some technical details were unclear. The story includes exploration tasks to gather needed information during implementation.
		
		Next Steps:
		1. Review story for accuracy
		2. Verify integration approach aligns with your system
		3. Approve story or request adjustments
		4. Dev agent can then implement with safety checks
		```
		
		## Success Criteria
		
		The brownfield story creation is successful when:
		
		1. Story can be implemented without requiring dev to search multiple documents
		2. Integration approach is clear and safe for existing system
		3. All available technical context has been extracted and organized
		4. Missing information has been identified and addressed
		5. Risks are documented with mitigation strategies
		6. Story includes verification of existing functionality
		7. Rollback approach is defined
		
		## Important Notes
		
		- This task is specifically for brownfield projects with non-standard documentation
		- Always prioritize existing system stability over new features
		- When in doubt, add exploration and verification tasks
		- It's better to ask the user for clarification than make assumptions
		- Each story should be self-contained for the dev agent
		- Include references to existing code patterns when available]]></file>

		# /create-doc Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)
		
		## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️
		
		**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**
		
		When this task is invoked:
		
		1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
		2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
		3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
		4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow
		
		**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.
		
		## Critical: Template Discovery
		
		If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.
		
		## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format
		
		**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**
		
		**YOU MUST:**
		
		1. Present section content
		2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
		3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
		   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
		   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
		   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
		4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback
		
		**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.
		
		**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**
		
		## Processing Flow
		
		1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
		2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
		3. **Process each section:**
		   - Skip if condition unmet
		   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
		   - Draft content using section instruction
		   - Present content + detailed rationale
		   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
		   - Save to file if possible
		4. **Continue until complete**
		
		## Detailed Rationale Requirements
		
		When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:
		
		- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
		- Key assumptions made during drafting
		- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
		- Areas that might need validation
		
		## Elicitation Results Flow
		
		After user selects elicitation method (2-9):
		
		1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
		2. Present results with insights
		3. Offer options:
		   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
		   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
		   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**
		
		## Agent Permissions
		
		When processing sections with agent permission fields:
		
		- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
		- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
		- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation
		
		**For sections with restricted access:**
		
		- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
		- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"
		
		## YOLO Mode
		
		User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).
		
		## CRITICAL REMINDERS
		
		**❌ NEVER:**
		
		- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
		- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
		- Create new elicitation methods
		
		**✅ ALWAYS:**
		
		- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
		- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
		- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
		- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"]]></file>
	<file path='.claude\commands\BMad\tasks\create-next-story.md'><![CDATA[
		# /create-next-story Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Create Next Story Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		To identify the next logical story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.
		
		## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)
		
		### 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow
		
		- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` from the project root
		- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy it from GITHUB bmad-core/core-config.yaml and configure it for your project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure core-config.yaml before proceeding."
		- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`
		
		### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation
		
		#### 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories
		
		- Based on `prdSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic PRD sections)
		- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
		- **If highest story exists:**
		  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
		  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
		  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
		  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
		- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
		- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"
		
		### 2. Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context
		
		- Extract story requirements from the identified epic file
		- If previous story exists, review Dev Agent Record sections for:
		  - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
		  - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
		  - Challenges encountered and lessons learned
		- Extract relevant insights that inform the current story's preparation
		
		### 3. Gather Architecture Context
		
		#### 3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy
		
		- **If `architectureVersion: >= v4` and `architectureSharded: true`**: Read `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md` then follow structured reading order below
		- **Else**: Use monolithic `architectureFile` for similar sections
		
		#### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type
		
		**For ALL Stories:** tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md
		
		**For Backend/API Stories, additionally:** data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md, rest-api-spec.md, external-apis.md
		
		**For Frontend/UI Stories, additionally:** frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md, data-models.md
		
		**For Full-Stack Stories:** Read both Backend and Frontend sections above
		
		#### 3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details
		
		Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story. Do NOT invent new libraries, patterns, or standards not in the source documents.
		
		Extract:
		
		- Specific data models, schemas, or structures the story will use
		- API endpoints the story must implement or consume
		- Component specifications for UI elements in the story
		- File paths and naming conventions for new code
		- Testing requirements specific to the story's features
		- Security or performance considerations affecting the story
		
		ALWAYS cite source documents: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
		
		### 4. Verify Project Structure Alignment
		
		- Cross-reference story requirements with Project Structure Guide from `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`
		- Ensure file paths, component locations, or module names align with defined structures
		- Document any structural conflicts in "Project Structure Notes" section within the story draft
		
		### 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context
		
		- Create new story file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` using Story Template
		- Fill in basic story information: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, Acceptance Criteria from Epic
		- **`Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**
		  - CRITICAL: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from architecture documents. NEVER invent or assume technical details.
		  - Include ALL relevant technical details from Steps 2-3, organized by category:
		    - **Previous Story Insights**: Key learnings from previous story
		    - **Data Models**: Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships [with source references]
		    - **API Specifications**: Endpoint details, request/response formats, auth requirements [with source references]
		    - **Component Specifications**: UI component details, props, state management [with source references]
		    - **File Locations**: Exact paths where new code should be created based on project structure
		    - **Testing Requirements**: Specific test cases or strategies from testing-strategy.md
		    - **Technical Constraints**: Version requirements, performance considerations, security rules
		  - Every technical detail MUST include its source reference: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
		  - If information for a category is not found in the architecture docs, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs"
		- **`Tasks / Subtasks` section:**
		  - Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information
		  - Each task must reference relevant architecture documentation
		  - Include unit testing as explicit subtasks based on the Testing Strategy
		  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`)
		- Add notes on project structure alignment or discrepancies found in Step 4
		
		### 6. Story Draft Completion and Review
		
		- Review all sections for completeness and accuracy
		- Verify all source references are included for technical details
		- Ensure tasks align with both epic requirements and architecture constraints
		- Update status to "Draft" and save the story file
		- Execute `.bmad-core/tasks/execute-checklist` `.bmad-core/checklists/story-draft-checklist`
		- Provide summary to user including:
		  - Story created: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
		  - Status: Draft
		  - Key technical components included from architecture docs
		  - Any deviations or conflicts noted between epic and architecture
		  - Checklist Results
		  - Next steps: For Complex stories, suggest the user carefully review the story draft and also optionally have the PO run the task `.bmad-core/tasks/validate-next-story`]]></file>

		# /document-project Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Document an Existing Project
		
		## Purpose
		
		Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. This task creates structured reference materials that enable AI agents to understand project context, conventions, and patterns for effective contribution to any codebase.
		
		## Task Instructions
		
		### 1. Initial Project Analysis
		
		**CRITICAL:** First, check if a PRD or requirements document exists in context. If yes, use it to focus your documentation efforts on relevant areas only.
		
		**IF PRD EXISTS**:
		
		- Review the PRD to understand what enhancement/feature is planned
		- Identify which modules, services, or areas will be affected
		- Focus documentation ONLY on these relevant areas
		- Skip unrelated parts of the codebase to keep docs lean
		
		**IF NO PRD EXISTS**:
		Ask the user:
		
		"I notice you haven't provided a PRD or requirements document. To create more focused and useful documentation, I recommend one of these options:
		
		1. **Create a PRD first** - Would you like me to help create a brownfield PRD before documenting? This helps focus documentation on relevant areas.
		
		2. **Provide existing requirements** - Do you have a requirements document, epic, or feature description you can share?
		
		3. **Describe the focus** - Can you briefly describe what enhancement or feature you're planning? For example:
		   - 'Adding payment processing to the user service'
		   - 'Refactoring the authentication module'
		   - 'Integrating with a new third-party API'
		
		4. **Document everything** - Or should I proceed with comprehensive documentation of the entire codebase? (Note: This may create excessive documentation for large projects)
		
		Please let me know your preference, or I can proceed with full documentation if you prefer."
		
		Based on their response:
		
		- If they choose option 1-3: Use that context to focus documentation
		- If they choose option 4 or decline: Proceed with comprehensive analysis below
		
		Begin by conducting analysis of the existing project. Use available tools to:
		
		1. **Project Structure Discovery**: Examine the root directory structure, identify main folders, and understand the overall organization
		2. **Technology Stack Identification**: Look for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc. to identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies
		3. **Build System Analysis**: Find build scripts, CI/CD configurations, and development commands
		4. **Existing Documentation Review**: Check for README files, docs folders, and any existing documentation
		5. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Sample key files to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches
		
		Ask the user these elicitation questions to better understand their needs:
		
		- What is the primary purpose of this project?
		- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are particularly complex or important for agents to understand?
		- What types of tasks do you expect AI agents to perform on this project? (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, testing)
		- Are there any existing documentation standards or formats you prefer?
		- What level of technical detail should the documentation target? (junior developers, senior developers, mixed team)
		- Is there a specific feature or enhancement you're planning? (This helps focus documentation)
		
		### 2. Deep Codebase Analysis
		
		CRITICAL: Before generating documentation, conduct extensive analysis of the existing codebase:
		
		1. **Explore Key Areas**:
		   - Entry points (main files, index files, app initializers)
		   - Configuration files and environment setup
		   - Package dependencies and versions
		   - Build and deployment configurations
		   - Test suites and coverage
		
		2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
		   - "I see you're using [technology X]. Are there any custom patterns or conventions I should document?"
		   - "What are the most critical/complex parts of this system that developers struggle with?"
		   - "Are there any undocumented 'tribal knowledge' areas I should capture?"
		   - "What technical debt or known issues should I document?"
		   - "Which parts of the codebase change most frequently?"
		
		3. **Map the Reality**:
		   - Identify ACTUAL patterns used (not theoretical best practices)
		   - Find where key business logic lives
		   - Locate integration points and external dependencies
		   - Document workarounds and technical debt
		   - Note areas that differ from standard patterns
		
		**IF PRD PROVIDED**: Also analyze what would need to change for the enhancement
		
		### 3. Core Documentation Generation
		
		[[LLM: Generate a comprehensive BROWNFIELD architecture document that reflects the ACTUAL state of the codebase.
		
		**CRITICAL**: This is NOT an aspirational architecture document. Document what EXISTS, including:
		
		- Technical debt and workarounds
		- Inconsistent patterns between different parts
		- Legacy code that can't be changed
		- Integration constraints
		- Performance bottlenecks
		
		**Document Structure**:
		
		# [Project Name] Brownfield Architecture Document
		
		## Introduction
		
		This document captures the CURRENT STATE of the [Project Name] codebase, including technical debt, workarounds, and real-world patterns. It serves as a reference for AI agents working on enhancements.
		
		### Document Scope
		
		[If PRD provided: "Focused on areas relevant to: {enhancement description}"]
		[If no PRD: "Comprehensive documentation of entire system"]

		[Highlight which files/modules will be affected by the planned enhancement]
		
		## High Level Architecture
		
		### Technical Summary
		
		### Actual Tech Stack (from package.json/requirements.txt)
		
		| Category  | Technology | Version | Notes                      |
		| --------- | ---------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
		| Runtime   | Node.js    | 16.x    | [Any constraints]          |
		| Framework | Express    | 4.18.2  | [Custom middleware?]       |
		| Database  | PostgreSQL | 13      | [Connection pooling setup] |
		
		etc...
		
		### Repository Structure Reality Check
		
		- Type: [Monorepo/Polyrepo/Hybrid]
		- Package Manager: [npm/yarn/pnpm]
		- Notable: [Any unusual structure decisions]
		
		## Source Tree and Module Organization
		
		### Project Structure (Actual)
		
		```text
		project-root/
		├── src/
		│   ├── controllers/     # HTTP request handlers
		│   ├── services/        # Business logic (NOTE: inconsistent patterns between user and payment services)
		│   ├── models/          # Database models (Sequelize)
		│   ├── utils/           # Mixed bag - needs refactoring
		│   └── legacy/          # DO NOT MODIFY - old payment system still in use
		├── tests/               # Jest tests (60% coverage)
		├── scripts/             # Build and deployment scripts
		└── config/              # Environment configs
		```
		
		### Key Modules and Their Purpose
		
		- **User Management**: `src/services/userService.js` - Handles all user operations
		- **Authentication**: `src/middleware/auth.js` - JWT-based, custom implementation
		- **Payment Processing**: `src/legacy/payment.js` - CRITICAL: Do not refactor, tightly coupled
		- **[List other key modules with their actual files]**
		
		## Data Models and APIs
		
		### Data Models
		
		Instead of duplicating, reference actual model files:
		
		- **User Model**: See `src/models/User.js`
		- **Order Model**: See `src/models/Order.js`
		- **Related Types**: TypeScript definitions in `src/types/`
		
		### API Specifications
		
		- **OpenAPI Spec**: `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (if exists)
		- **Postman Collection**: `docs/api/postman-collection.json`
		- **Manual Endpoints**: [List any undocumented endpoints discovered]
		
		## Technical Debt and Known Issues
		
		### Critical Technical Debt
		
		1. **Payment Service**: Legacy code in `src/legacy/payment.js` - tightly coupled, no tests
		2. **User Service**: Different pattern than other services, uses callbacks instead of promises
		3. **Database Migrations**: Manually tracked, no proper migration tool
		4. **[Other significant debt]**
		
		### Workarounds and Gotchas
		
		- **Environment Variables**: Must set `NODE_ENV=production` even for staging (historical reason)
		- **Database Connections**: Connection pool hardcoded to 10, changing breaks payment service
		- **[Other workarounds developers need to know]**
		
		## Integration Points and External Dependencies
		
		### External Services
		
		| Service  | Purpose  | Integration Type | Key Files                      |
		| -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
		| Stripe   | Payments | REST API         | `src/integrations/stripe/`     |
		| SendGrid | Emails   | SDK              | `src/services/emailService.js` |
		
		etc...
		
		### Internal Integration Points
		
		- **Frontend Communication**: REST API on port 3000, expects specific headers
		- **Background Jobs**: Redis queue, see `src/workers/`
		- **[Other integrations]**
		
		## Development and Deployment
		
		### Local Development Setup
		
		1. Actual steps that work (not ideal steps)
		2. Known issues with setup
		3. Required environment variables (see `.env.example`)
		
		### Build and Deployment Process
		
		- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (webpack config in `webpack.config.js`)
		- **Deployment**: Manual deployment via `scripts/deploy.sh`
		- **Environments**: Dev, Staging, Prod (see `config/environments/`)
		
		## Testing Reality
		
		### Current Test Coverage
		
		- Unit Tests: 60% coverage (Jest)
		- Integration Tests: Minimal, in `tests/integration/`
		- E2E Tests: None
		- Manual Testing: Primary QA method
		
		### Running Tests
		
		```bash
		npm test           # Runs unit tests
		npm run test:integration  # Runs integration tests (requires local DB)
		```
		
		## If Enhancement PRD Provided - Impact Analysis
		
		### Files That Will Need Modification
		
		Based on the enhancement requirements, these files will be affected:
		
		- `src/services/userService.js` - Add new user fields
		- `src/models/User.js` - Update schema
		- `src/routes/userRoutes.js` - New endpoints
		- [etc...]
		
		### New Files/Modules Needed
		
		- `src/services/newFeatureService.js` - New business logic
		- `src/models/NewFeature.js` - New data model
		- [etc...]
		
		### Integration Considerations
		
		- Will need to integrate with existing auth middleware
		- Must follow existing response format in `src/utils/responseFormatter.js`
		- [Other integration points]
		
		## Appendix - Useful Commands and Scripts
		
		### Frequently Used Commands
		
		```bash
		npm run dev         # Start development server
		npm run build       # Production build
		npm run migrate     # Run database migrations
		npm run seed        # Seed test data
		```
		
		### Debugging and Troubleshooting
		
		- **Logs**: Check `logs/app.log` for application logs
		- **Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG=app:*` for verbose logging
		- **Common Issues**: See `docs/troubleshooting.md`]]
		
		### 4. Document Delivery
		
		1. **In Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)**:
		   - Present the entire document in one response (or multiple if too long)
		   - Tell user to copy and save as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
		   - Mention it can be sharded later in IDE if needed
		
		2. **In IDE Environment**:
		   - Create the document as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
		   - Inform user this single document contains all architectural information
		   - Can be sharded later using PO agent if desired
		
		The document should be comprehensive enough that future agents can understand:
		
		- The actual state of the system (not idealized)
		- Where to find key files and logic
		- What technical debt exists
		- What constraints must be respected
		- If PRD provided: What needs to change for the enhancement]]
		
		### 5. Quality Assurance
		
		CRITICAL: Before finalizing the document:
		
		1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all technical details match the actual codebase
		2. **Completeness Review**: Ensure all major system components are documented
		3. **Focus Validation**: If user provided scope, verify relevant areas are emphasized
		4. **Clarity Assessment**: Check that explanations are clear for AI agents
		5. **Navigation**: Ensure document has clear section structure for easy reference
		
		Apply the advanced elicitation task after major sections to refine based on user feedback.
		
		## Success Criteria
		
		- Single comprehensive brownfield architecture document created
		- Document reflects REALITY including technical debt and workarounds
		- Key files and modules are referenced with actual paths
		- Models/APIs reference source files rather than duplicating content
		- If PRD provided: Clear impact analysis showing what needs to change
		- Document enables AI agents to navigate and understand the actual codebase
		- Technical constraints and "gotchas" are clearly documented
		
		## Notes
		
		- This task creates ONE document that captures the TRUE state of the system
		- References actual files rather than duplicating content when possible
		- Documents technical debt, workarounds, and constraints honestly
		- For brownfield projects with PRD: Provides clear enhancement impact analysis
		- The goal is PRACTICAL documentation for AI agents doing real work]]></file>

		# /execute-checklist Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Checklist Validation Task
		
		This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.
		
		## Available Checklists
		
		If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.
		
		## Instructions
		
		1. **Initial Assessment**
		   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
		     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
		     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
		     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-core/checklists/
		   - If no checklist specified:
		     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
		     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
		   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
		     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
		     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)
		
		2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
		   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
		   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.
		
		3. **Checklist Processing**
		
		   If in interactive mode:
		   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
		   - For each section:
		     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
		     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
		     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
		     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action
		
		   If in YOLO mode:
		   - Process all sections at once
		   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
		   - Present the complete analysis to the user
		
		4. **Validation Approach**
		
		   For each checklist item:
		   - Read and understand the requirement
		   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
		   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
		   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
		   - Mark items as:
		     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
		     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
		     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
		     - N/A: Not applicable to this case
		
		5. **Section Analysis**
		
		   For each section:
		   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
		   - Identify common themes in failed items
		   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
		   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
		   - Document any user decisions or explanations
		
		6. **Final Report**
		
		   Prepare a summary that includes:
		   - Overall checklist completion status
		   - Pass rates by section
		   - List of failed items with context
		   - Specific recommendations for improvement
		   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification
		
		## Checklist Execution Methodology
		
		Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:
		
		1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
		2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
		3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
		4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings
		
		The LLM will:
		
		- Execute the complete checklist validation
		- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
		- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures]]></file>

		# /facilitate-brainstorming-session Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		## <!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		docOutputLocation: docs/brainstorming-session-results.md
		template: '.bmad-core/templates/brainstorming-output-tmpl.yaml'
		
		---
		
		# Facilitate Brainstorming Session Task
		
		Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions with users. Be creative and adaptive in applying techniques.
		
		## Process
		
		### Step 1: Session Setup
		
		Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):
		
		1. What are we brainstorming about?
		2. Any constraints or parameters?
		3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
		4. Do you want a structured document output to reference later? (Default Yes)
		
		### Step 2: Present Approach Options
		
		After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):
		
		1. User selects specific techniques
		2. Analyst recommends techniques based on context
		3. Random technique selection for creative variety
		4. Progressive technique flow (start broad, narrow down)
		
		### Step 3: Execute Techniques Interactively
		
		**KEY PRINCIPLES:**
		
		- **FACILITATOR ROLE**: Guide user to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples
		- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Keep user engaged with chosen technique until they want to switch or are satisfied
		- **CAPTURE OUTPUT**: If (default) document output requested, capture all ideas generated in each technique section to the document from the beginning.
		
		**Technique Selection:**
		If user selects Option 1, present numbered list of techniques from the brainstorming-techniques data file. User can select by number..
		
		**Technique Execution:**
		
		1. Apply selected technique according to data file description
		2. Keep engaging with technique until user indicates they want to:
		   - Choose a different technique
		   - Apply current ideas to a new technique
		   - Move to convergent phase
		   - End session
		
		**Output Capture (if requested):**
		For each technique used, capture:
		
		- Technique name and duration
		- Key ideas generated by user
		- Insights and patterns identified
		- User's reflections on the process
		
		### Step 4: Session Flow
		
		1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence
		2. **Divergent** (20-30 min) - Generate quantity over quality
		3. **Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and categorize ideas
		4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine and develop concepts
		
		### Step 5: Document Output (if requested)
		
		Generate structured document with these sections:
		
		**Executive Summary**
		
		- Session topic and goals
		- Techniques used and duration
		- Total ideas generated
		- Key themes and patterns identified
		
		**Technique Sections** (for each technique used)
		
		- Technique name and description
		- Ideas generated (user's own words)
		- Insights discovered
		- Notable connections or patterns
		
		**Idea Categorization**
		
		- **Immediate Opportunities** - Ready to implement now
		- **Future Innovations** - Requires development/research
		- **Moonshots** - Ambitious, transformative concepts
		- **Insights & Learnings** - Key realizations from session
		
		**Action Planning**
		
		- Top 3 priority ideas with rationale
		- Next steps for each priority
		- Resources/research needed
		- Timeline considerations
		
		**Reflection & Follow-up**
		
		- What worked well in this session
		- Areas for further exploration
		- Recommended follow-up techniques
		- Questions that emerged for future sessions
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- **YOU ARE A FACILITATOR**: Guide the user to brainstorm, don't brainstorm for them (unless they request it persistently)
		- **INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE**: Ask questions, wait for responses, build on their ideas
		- **ONE TECHNIQUE AT A TIME**: Don't mix multiple techniques in one response
		- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Stay with one technique until user wants to switch
		- **DRAW IDEAS OUT**: Use prompts and examples to help them generate their own ideas
		- **REAL-TIME ADAPTATION**: Monitor engagement and adjust approach as needed
		- Maintain energy and momentum
		- Defer judgment during generation
		- Quantity leads to quality (aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes)
		- Build on ideas collaboratively
		- Document everything in output document
		
		## Advanced Engagement Strategies
		
		**Energy Management**
		
		- Check engagement levels: "How are you feeling about this direction?"
		- Offer breaks or technique switches if energy flags
		- Use encouraging language and celebrate idea generation
		
		**Depth vs. Breadth**
		
		- Ask follow-up questions to deepen ideas: "Tell me more about that..."
		- Use "Yes, and..." to build on their ideas
		- Help them make connections: "How does this relate to your earlier idea about...?"
		
		**Transition Management**
		
		- Always ask before switching techniques: "Ready to try a different approach?"
		- Offer options: "Should we explore this idea deeper or generate more alternatives?"
		- Respect their process and timing]]></file>

		# /generate-ai-frontend-prompt Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Create AI Frontend Prompt Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		To generate a masterful, comprehensive, and optimized prompt that can be used with any AI-driven frontend development tool (e.g., Vercel v0, Lovable.ai, or similar) to scaffold or generate significant portions of a frontend application.
		
		## Inputs
		
		- Completed UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec.md`)
		- Completed Frontend Architecture Document (`front-end-architecture`) or a full stack combined architecture such as `architecture.md`
		- Main System Architecture Document (`architecture` - for API contracts and tech stack to give further context)
		
		## Key Activities & Instructions
		
		### 1. Core Prompting Principles
		
		Before generating the prompt, you must understand these core principles for interacting with a generative AI for code.
		
		- **Be Explicit and Detailed**: The AI cannot read your mind. Provide as much detail and context as possible. Vague requests lead to generic or incorrect outputs.
		- **Iterate, Don't Expect Perfection**: Generating an entire complex application in one go is rare. The most effective method is to prompt for one component or one section at a time, then build upon the results.
		- **Provide Context First**: Always start by providing the AI with the necessary context, such as the tech stack, existing code snippets, and overall project goals.
		- **Mobile-First Approach**: Frame all UI generation requests with a mobile-first design mindset. Describe the mobile layout first, then provide separate instructions for how it should adapt for tablet and desktop.
		
		### 2. The Structured Prompting Framework
		
		To ensure the highest quality output, you MUST structure every prompt using the following four-part framework.
		
		1. **High-Level Goal**: Start with a clear, concise summary of the overall objective. This orients the AI on the primary task.
		   - _Example: "Create a responsive user registration form with client-side validation and API integration."_
		2. **Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions**: Provide a granular, numbered list of actions the AI should take. Break down complex tasks into smaller, sequential steps. This is the most critical part of the prompt.
		   - _Example: "1. Create a new file named `RegistrationForm.js`. 2. Use React hooks for state management. 3. Add styled input fields for 'Name', 'Email', and 'Password'. 4. For the email field, ensure it is a valid email format. 5. On submission, call the API endpoint defined below."_
		3. **Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints**: Include any relevant snippets of existing code, data structures, or API contracts. This gives the AI concrete examples to work with. Crucially, you must also state what _not_ to do.
		   - _Example: "Use this API endpoint: `POST /api/register`. The expected JSON payload is `{ "name": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string" }`. Do NOT include a 'confirm password' field. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling."_
		4. **Define a Strict Scope**: Explicitly define the boundaries of the task. Tell the AI which files it can modify and, more importantly, which files to leave untouched to prevent unintended changes across the codebase.
		   - _Example: "You should only create the `RegistrationForm.js` component and add it to the `pages/register.js` file. Do NOT alter the `Navbar.js` component or any other existing page or component."_
		
		### 3. Assembling the Master Prompt
		
		You will now synthesize the inputs and the above principles into a final, comprehensive prompt.
		
		1. **Gather Foundational Context**:
		   - Start the prompt with a preamble describing the overall project purpose, the full tech stack (e.g., Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS), and the primary UI component library being used.
		2. **Describe the Visuals**:
		   - If the user has design files (Figma, etc.), instruct them to provide links or screenshots.
		   - If not, describe the visual style: color palette, typography, spacing, and overall aesthetic (e.g., "minimalist", "corporate", "playful").
		3. **Build the Prompt using the Structured Framework**:
		   - Follow the four-part framework from Section 2 to build out the core request, whether it's for a single component or a full page.
		4. **Present and Refine**:
		   - Output the complete, generated prompt in a clear, copy-pasteable format (e.g., a large code block).
		   - Explain the structure of the prompt and why certain information was included, referencing the principles above.
		   - <important_note>Conclude by reminding the user that all AI-generated code will require careful human review, testing, and refinement to be considered production-ready.</important_note>]]></file>

		# /index-docs Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Index Documentation Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		This task maintains the integrity and completeness of the `docs/index.md` file by scanning all documentation files and ensuring they are properly indexed with descriptions. It handles both root-level documents and documents within subfolders, organizing them hierarchically.
		
		## Task Instructions
		
		You are now operating as a Documentation Indexer. Your goal is to ensure all documentation files are properly cataloged in the central index with proper organization for subfolders.
		
		### Required Steps
		
		1. First, locate and scan:
		   - The `docs/` directory and all subdirectories
		   - The existing `docs/index.md` file (create if absent)
		   - All markdown (`.md`) and text (`.txt`) files in the documentation structure
		   - Note the folder structure for hierarchical organization
		
		2. For the existing `docs/index.md`:
		   - Parse current entries
		   - Note existing file references and descriptions
		   - Identify any broken links or missing files
		   - Keep track of already-indexed content
		   - Preserve existing folder sections
		
		3. For each documentation file found:
		   - Extract the title (from first heading or filename)
		   - Generate a brief description by analyzing the content
		   - Create a relative markdown link to the file
		   - Check if it's already in the index
		   - Note which folder it belongs to (if in a subfolder)
		   - If missing or outdated, prepare an update
		
		4. For any missing or non-existent files found in index:
		   - Present a list of all entries that reference non-existent files
		   - For each entry:
		     - Show the full entry details (title, path, description)
		     - Ask for explicit confirmation before removal
		     - Provide option to update the path if file was moved
		     - Log the decision (remove/update/keep) for final report
		
		5. Update `docs/index.md`:
		   - Maintain existing structure and organization
		   - Create level 2 sections (`##`) for each subfolder
		   - List root-level documents first
		   - Add missing entries with descriptions
		   - Update outdated entries
		   - Remove only entries that were confirmed for removal
		   - Ensure consistent formatting throughout
		
		### Index Structure Format
		
		The index should be organized as follows:
		
		```markdown
		# Documentation Index
		
		## Root Documents
		
		### [Document Title](./document.md)
		
		Brief description of the document's purpose and contents.
		
		### [Another Document](./another.md)
		
		Description here.
		
		## Folder Name
		
		Documents within the `folder-name/` directory:
		
		### [Document in Folder](./folder-name/document.md)
		
		Description of this document.
		
		### [Another in Folder](./folder-name/another.md)
		
		Description here.
		
		## Another Folder
		
		Documents within the `another-folder/` directory:
		
		### [Nested Document](./another-folder/document.md)
		
		Description of nested document.
		```
		
		### Index Entry Format
		
		Each entry should follow this format:
		
		```markdown
		### [Document Title](relative/path/to/file.md)
		
		Brief description of the document's purpose and contents.
		```
		
		### Rules of Operation
		
		1. NEVER modify the content of indexed files
		2. Preserve existing descriptions in index.md when they are adequate
		3. Maintain any existing categorization or grouping in the index
		4. Use relative paths for all links (starting with `./`)
		5. Ensure descriptions are concise but informative
		6. NEVER remove entries without explicit confirmation
		7. Report any broken links or inconsistencies found
		8. Allow path updates for moved files before considering removal
		9. Create folder sections using level 2 headings (`##`)
		10. Sort folders alphabetically, with root documents listed first
		11. Within each section, sort documents alphabetically by title
		
		### Process Output
		
		The task will provide:
		
		1. A summary of changes made to index.md
		2. List of newly indexed files (organized by folder)
		3. List of updated entries
		4. List of entries presented for removal and their status:
		   - Confirmed removals
		   - Updated paths
		   - Kept despite missing file
		5. Any new folders discovered
		6. Any other issues or inconsistencies found
		
		### Handling Missing Files
		
		For each file referenced in the index but not found in the filesystem:
		
		1. Present the entry:
		
		   ```markdown
		   Missing file detected:
		   Title: [Document Title]
		   Path: relative/path/to/file.md
		   Description: Existing description
		   Section: [Root Documents | Folder Name]
		
		   Options:
		
		   1. Remove this entry

		   ```
		
		2. Wait for user confirmation before taking any action
		3. Log the decision for the final report
		
		### Special Cases
		
		1. **Sharded Documents**: If a folder contains an `index.md` file, treat it as a sharded document:
		   - Use the folder's `index.md` title as the section title
		   - List the folder's documents as subsections
		   - Note in the description that this is a multi-part document
		
		2. **README files**: Convert `README.md` to more descriptive titles based on content
		
		3. **Nested Subfolders**: For deeply nested folders, maintain the hierarchy but limit to 2 levels in the main index. Deeper structures should have their own index files.
		
		## Required Input
		
		Please provide:
		
		1. Location of the `docs/` directory (default: `./docs`)
		2. Confirmation of write access to `docs/index.md`
		3. Any specific categorization preferences
		4. Any files or directories to exclude from indexing (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`)
		5. Whether to include hidden files/folders (starting with `.`)

		# /nfr-assess Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# nfr-assess
		
		Quick NFR validation focused on the core four: security, performance, reliability, maintainability.
		
		## Inputs
		
		```yaml
		required:
		  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
		  - story_path: `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` for the `devStoryLocation`
		
		optional:
		  - architecture_refs: `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` for the `architecture.architectureFile`
		  - technical_preferences: `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` for the `technicalPreferences`
		  - acceptance_criteria: From story file
		```
		
		## Purpose
		
		Assess non-functional requirements for a story and generate:
		
		1. YAML block for the gate file's `nfr_validation` section
		2. Brief markdown assessment saved to `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
		
		## Process
		
		### 0. Fail-safe for Missing Inputs
		
		If story_path or story file can't be found:
		
		- Still create assessment file with note: "Source story not found"
		- Set all selected NFRs to CONCERNS with notes: "Target unknown / evidence missing"
		- Continue with assessment to provide value
		
		### 1. Elicit Scope
		
		**Interactive mode:** Ask which NFRs to assess
		**Non-interactive mode:** Default to core four (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
		
		```text
		Which NFRs should I assess? (Enter numbers or press Enter for default)
		[1] Security (default)
		[2] Performance (default)
		[3] Reliability (default)
		[4] Maintainability (default)
		[5] Usability
		[6] Compatibility
		[7] Portability
		[8] Functional Suitability
		
		> [Enter for 1-4]
		```
		
		### 2. Check for Thresholds
		
		Look for NFR requirements in:
		
		- Story acceptance criteria
		- `docs/architecture/*.md` files
		- `docs/technical-preferences.md`
		
		**Interactive mode:** Ask for missing thresholds
		**Non-interactive mode:** Mark as CONCERNS with "Target unknown"
		
		```text
		No performance requirements found. What's your target response time?
		> 200ms for API calls
		
		No security requirements found. Required auth method?
		> JWT with refresh tokens
		```
		
		**Unknown targets policy:** If a target is missing and not provided, mark status as CONCERNS with notes: "Target unknown"
		
		### 3. Quick Assessment
		
		For each selected NFR, check:
		
		- Is there evidence it's implemented?
		- Can we validate it?
		- Are there obvious gaps?
		
		### 4. Generate Outputs
		
		## Output 1: Gate YAML Block
		
		Generate ONLY for NFRs actually assessed (no placeholders):
		
		```yaml
		# Gate YAML (copy/paste):
		nfr_validation:
		  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
		  security:
		    status: CONCERNS
		    notes: 'No rate limiting on auth endpoints'
		  performance:
		    status: PASS
		    notes: 'Response times < 200ms verified'
		  reliability:
		    status: PASS
		    notes: 'Error handling and retries implemented'
		  maintainability:
		    status: CONCERNS
		    notes: 'Test coverage at 65%, target is 80%'
		```
		
		## Deterministic Status Rules
		
		- **FAIL**: Any selected NFR has critical gap or target clearly not met
		- **CONCERNS**: No FAILs, but any NFR is unknown/partial/missing evidence
		- **PASS**: All selected NFRs meet targets with evidence
		
		## Quality Score Calculation
		
		```
		quality_score = 100
		- 20 for each FAIL attribute
		- 10 for each CONCERNS attribute
		Floor at 0, ceiling at 100
		```
		
		If `technical-preferences.md` defines custom weights, use those instead.
		
		## Output 2: Brief Assessment Report
		
		**ALWAYS save to:** `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
		
		```markdown
		# NFR Assessment: {epic}.{story}
		
		Date: {date}
		Reviewer: Quinn
		
		<!-- Note: Source story not found (if applicable) -->
		
		## Summary
		
		- Security: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting
		- Performance: PASS - Meets <200ms requirement
		- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling
		- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test coverage below target
		
		## Critical Issues
		
		1. **No rate limiting** (Security)
		   - Risk: Brute force attacks possible
		   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to auth endpoints
		
		2. **Test coverage 65%** (Maintainability)
		   - Risk: Untested code paths
		   - Fix: Add tests for uncovered branches
		
		## Quick Wins
		
		- Add rate limiting: ~2 hours
		- Increase test coverage: ~4 hours
		- Add performance monitoring: ~1 hour
		```
		
		## Output 3: Story Update Line
		
		**End with this line for the review task to quote:**
		
		```
		NFR assessment: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-nfr-{YYYYMMDD}.md
		```
		
		## Output 4: Gate Integration Line
		
		**Always print at the end:**
		
		```
		Gate NFR block ready → paste into qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml under nfr_validation
		```
		
		## Assessment Criteria

		# /qa-gate Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# qa-gate
		
		Create or update a quality gate decision file for a story based on review findings.
		
		## Purpose
		
		Generate a standalone quality gate file that provides a clear pass/fail decision with actionable feedback. This gate serves as an advisory checkpoint for teams to understand quality status.
		
		## Prerequisites
		
		- Story has been reviewed (manually or via review-story task)
		- Review findings are available
		- Understanding of story requirements and implementation
		
		## Gate File Location
		
		**ALWAYS** check the `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` for the `qa.qaLocation/gates`
		
		Slug rules:
		
		- Convert to lowercase
		- Replace spaces with hyphens
		- Strip punctuation
		- Example: "User Auth - Login!" becomes "user-auth-login"
		
		## Minimal Required Schema
		
		```yaml
		schema: 1
		story: '{epic}.{story}'
		gate: PASS|CONCERNS|FAIL|WAIVED
		status_reason: '1-2 sentence explanation of gate decision'
		reviewer: 'Quinn'
		updated: '{ISO-8601 timestamp}'
		top_issues: [] # Empty array if no issues
		waiver: { active: false } # Only set active: true if WAIVED
		```
		
		## Schema with Issues
		
		```yaml
		schema: 1
		story: '1.3'
		gate: CONCERNS
		status_reason: 'Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints poses security risk.'

		    severity: low
		    finding: 'Dashboard loads slowly with 1000+ items'
		    suggested_action: 'Implement pagination in next sprint'
		waiver:
		  active: true
		  reason: 'MVP release - performance optimization deferred'
		  approved_by: 'Product Owner'
		```
		
		## Gate Decision Criteria
		
		### PASS
		
		- All acceptance criteria met
		- No high-severity issues
		- Test coverage meets project standards
		
		### CONCERNS
		
		- Non-blocking issues present
		- Should be tracked and scheduled
		- Can proceed with awareness
		
		### FAIL
		
		- Acceptance criteria not met
		- High-severity issues present
		- Recommend return to InProgress
		
		### WAIVED
		
		- Issues explicitly accepted
		- Requires approval and reason
		- Proceed despite known issues
		
		## Severity Scale
		
		**FIXED VALUES - NO VARIATIONS:**
		
		- `low`: Minor issues, cosmetic problems
		- `medium`: Should fix soon, not blocking
		- `high`: Critical issues, should block release
		
		## Issue ID Prefixes
		
		- `SEC-`: Security issues
		- `PERF-`: Performance issues
		- `REL-`: Reliability issues
		- `TEST-`: Testing gaps
		- `MNT-`: Maintainability concerns
		- `ARCH-`: Architecture issues
		- `DOC-`: Documentation gaps
		- `REQ-`: Requirements issues
		
		## Output Requirements
		
		1. **ALWAYS** create gate file at: `qa.qaLocation/gates` from `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
		2. **ALWAYS** append this exact format to story's QA Results section:
		
		   ```text
		   Gate: {STATUS} → qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
		   ```
		
		3. Keep status_reason to 1-2 sentences maximum
		4. Use severity values exactly: `low`, `medium`, or `high`
		
		## Example Story Update
		
		After creating gate file, append to story's QA Results section:
		
		```markdown
		## QA Results
		
		### Review Date: 2025-01-12
		
		### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)
		
		[... existing review content ...]
		
		### Gate Status
		
		Gate: CONCERNS → qa.qaLocation/gates/{epic}.{story}-{slug}.yml
		```
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- Keep it minimal and predictable
		- Fixed severity scale (low/medium/high)
		- Always write to standard path
		- Always update story with gate reference
		- Clear, actionable findings]]></file>
	<file path='.claude\commands\BMad\tasks\review-story.md'><![CDATA[
		# /review-story Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# review-story
		
		Perform a comprehensive test architecture review with quality gate decision. This adaptive, risk-aware review creates both a story update and a detailed gate file.
		
		## Inputs
		
		```yaml
		required:
		  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
		  - story_path: '{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md' # Path from core-config.yaml
		  - story_title: '{title}' # If missing, derive from story file H1
		  - story_slug: '{slug}' # If missing, derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated)
		```
		
		## Prerequisites
		
		- Story status must be "Review"
		- Developer has completed all tasks and updated the File List
		- All automated tests are passing
		
		## Review Process - Adaptive Test Architecture
		
		### 1. Risk Assessment (Determines Review Depth)
		
		**Auto-escalate to deep review when:**
		
		- Auth/payment/security files touched
		- No tests added to story
		- Diff > 500 lines
		- Previous gate was FAIL/CONCERNS
		- Story has > 5 acceptance criteria
		
		### 2. Comprehensive Analysis
		
		**A. Requirements Traceability**
		
		- Map each acceptance criteria to its validating tests (document mapping with Given-When-Then, not test code)
		- Identify coverage gaps
		- Verify all requirements have corresponding test cases
		
		**B. Code Quality Review**
		
		- Architecture and design patterns
		- Refactoring opportunities (and perform them)
		- Code duplication or inefficiencies
		- Performance optimizations
		- Security vulnerabilities
		- Best practices adherence
		
		**C. Test Architecture Assessment**
		
		- Test coverage adequacy at appropriate levels
		- Test level appropriateness (what should be unit vs integration vs e2e)
		- Test design quality and maintainability
		- Test data management strategy
		- Mock/stub usage appropriateness
		- Edge case and error scenario coverage
		- Test execution time and reliability
		
		**D. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
		
		- Security: Authentication, authorization, data protection
		- Performance: Response times, resource usage
		- Reliability: Error handling, recovery mechanisms
		- Maintainability: Code clarity, documentation
		
		**E. Testability Evaluation**
		
		- Controllability: Can we control the inputs?
		- Observability: Can we observe the outputs?
		- Debuggability: Can we debug failures easily?
		
		**F. Technical Debt Identification**
		
		- Accumulated shortcuts
		- Missing tests
		- Outdated dependencies
		- Architecture violations
		
		### 3. Active Refactoring
		
		- Refactor code where safe and appropriate
		- Run tests to ensure changes don't break functionality
		- Document all changes in QA Results section with clear WHY and HOW
		- Do NOT alter story content beyond QA Results section
		- Do NOT change story Status or File List; recommend next status only
		
		### 4. Standards Compliance Check
		
		- Verify adherence to `docs/coding-standards.md`
		- Check compliance with `docs/unified-project-structure.md`
		- Validate testing approach against `docs/testing-strategy.md`
		- Ensure all guidelines mentioned in the story are followed
		
		### 5. Acceptance Criteria Validation
		
		- Verify each AC is fully implemented
		- Check for any missing functionality
		- Validate edge cases are handled
		
		### 6. Documentation and Comments
		
		- Verify code is self-documenting where possible
		- Add comments for complex logic if missing
		- Ensure any API changes are documented
		
		## Output 1: Update Story File - QA Results Section ONLY
		
		**CRITICAL**: You are ONLY authorized to update the "QA Results" section of the story file. DO NOT modify any other sections.
		
		**QA Results Anchor Rule:**
		
		- If `## QA Results` doesn't exist, append it at end of file
		- If it exists, append a new dated entry below existing entries
		- Never edit other sections
		
		After review and any refactoring, append your results to the story file in the QA Results section:
		
		```markdown
		## QA Results

		### Gate Decision Criteria
		
		**Deterministic rule (apply in order):**
		
		If risk_summary exists, apply its thresholds first (≥9 → FAIL, ≥6 → CONCERNS), then NFR statuses, then top_issues severity.
		
		1. **Risk thresholds (if risk_summary present):**
		   - If any risk score ≥ 9 → Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
		   - Else if any score ≥ 6 → Gate = CONCERNS
		
		2. **Test coverage gaps (if trace available):**
		   - If any P0 test from test-design is missing → Gate = CONCERNS
		   - If security/data-loss P0 test missing → Gate = FAIL
		
		3. **Issue severity:**
		   - If any `top_issues.severity == high` → Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
		   - Else if any `severity == medium` → Gate = CONCERNS
		
		4. **NFR statuses:**
		   - If any NFR status is FAIL → Gate = FAIL
		   - Else if any NFR status is CONCERNS → Gate = CONCERNS
		   - Else → Gate = PASS
		
		- WAIVED only when waiver.active: true with reason/approver
		
		Detailed criteria:
		
		- **PASS**: All critical requirements met, no blocking issues
		- **CONCERNS**: Non-critical issues found, team should review
		- **FAIL**: Critical issues that should be addressed
		- **WAIVED**: Issues acknowledged but explicitly waived by team
		
		### Quality Score Calculation
		
		```text
		quality_score = 100 - (20 × number of FAILs) - (10 × number of CONCERNS)
		Bounded between 0 and 100
		```
		
		If `technical-preferences.md` defines custom weights, use those instead.
		
		### Suggested Owner Convention
		
		For each issue in `top_issues`, include a `suggested_owner`:
		
		- `dev`: Code changes needed
		- `sm`: Requirements clarification needed
		- `po`: Business decision needed
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- You are a Test Architect providing comprehensive quality assessment
		- You have the authority to improve code directly when appropriate
		- Always explain your changes for learning purposes
		- Balance between perfection and pragmatism
		- Focus on risk-based prioritization
		- Provide actionable recommendations with clear ownership
		
		## Blocking Conditions
		
		Stop the review and request clarification if:
		
		- Story file is incomplete or missing critical sections
		- File List is empty or clearly incomplete
		- No tests exist when they were required
		- Code changes don't align with story requirements
		- Critical architectural issues that require discussion
		
		## Completion
		
		After review:
		
		1. Update the QA Results section in the story file
		2. Create the gate file in directory from `qa.qaLocation/gates`
		3. Recommend status: "Ready for Done" or "Changes Required" (owner decides)
		4. If files were modified, list them in QA Results and ask Dev to update File List
		5. Always provide constructive feedback and actionable recommendations]]></file>

		## Risk Analysis Process
		
		### 1. Risk Identification
		
		For each category, identify specific risks:
		
		```yaml
		risk:
		  id: 'SEC-001' # Use prefixes: SEC, PERF, DATA, BUS, OPS, TECH
		  category: security
		  title: 'Insufficient input validation on user forms'
		  description: 'Form inputs not properly sanitized could lead to XSS attacks'
		  affected_components:
		    - 'UserRegistrationForm'
		    - 'ProfileUpdateForm'
		  detection_method: 'Code review revealed missing validation'
		```
		
		### 2. Risk Assessment
		
		Evaluate each risk using probability × impact:
		
		**Probability Levels:**
		
		- `High (3)`: Likely to occur (>70% chance)
		- `Medium (2)`: Possible occurrence (30-70% chance)
		- `Low (1)`: Unlikely to occur (<30% chance)
		
		**Impact Levels:**
		
		- `High (3)`: Severe consequences (data breach, system down, major financial loss)
		- `Medium (2)`: Moderate consequences (degraded performance, minor data issues)
		- `Low (1)`: Minor consequences (cosmetic issues, slight inconvenience)
		
		### Risk Score = Probability × Impact
		
		- 9: Critical Risk (Red)
		- 6: High Risk (Orange)
		- 4: Medium Risk (Yellow)
		- 2-3: Low Risk (Green)
		- 1: Minimal Risk (Blue)
		
		### 3. Risk Prioritization
		
		Create risk matrix:
		
		```markdown
		## Risk Matrix
		
		| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
		| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
		| SEC-001  | XSS vulnerability       | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical |
		| PERF-001 | Slow query on dashboard | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
		| DATA-001 | Backup failure          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
		```
		
		### 4. Risk Mitigation Strategies
		
		For each identified risk, provide mitigation:
		
		```yaml
		mitigation:
		  risk_id: 'SEC-001'
		  strategy: 'preventive' # preventive|detective|corrective
		  actions:
		    - 'Implement input validation library (e.g., validator.js)'
		    - 'Add CSP headers to prevent XSS execution'
		    - 'Sanitize all user inputs before storage'
		    - 'Escape all outputs in templates'
		  testing_requirements:
		    - 'Security testing with OWASP ZAP'
		    - 'Manual penetration testing of forms'
		    - 'Unit tests for validation functions'
		  residual_risk: 'Low - Some zero-day vulnerabilities may remain'
		  owner: 'dev'
		  timeline: 'Before deployment'
		```
		
		## Outputs
		
		### Output 1: Gate YAML Block
		
		Generate for pasting into gate file under `risk_summary`:
		
		**Output rules:**
		
		- Only include assessed risks; do not emit placeholders
		- Sort risks by score (desc) when emitting highest and any tabular lists
		- If no risks: totals all zeros, omit highest, keep recommendations arrays empty
		
		```yaml
		# risk_summary (paste into gate file):
		risk_summary:
		  totals:
		    critical: X # score 9
		    high: Y # score 6
		    medium: Z # score 4
		    low: W # score 2-3
		  highest:
		    id: SEC-001
		    score: 9
		    title: 'XSS on profile form'
		  recommendations:
		    must_fix:
		      - 'Add input sanitization & CSP'
		    monitor:
		      - 'Add security alerts for auth endpoints'
		```
		
		### Output 2: Markdown Report
		
		**Save to:** `qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md`
		
		```markdown
		# Risk Profile: Story {epic}.{story}
		
		Date: {date}
		Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
		
		## Executive Summary
		
		- Total Risks Identified: X
		- Critical Risks: Y
		- High Risks: Z
		- Risk Score: XX/100 (calculated)
		
		## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention
		
		### 1. [ID]: Risk Title
		
		**Score: 9 (Critical)**
		**Probability**: High - Detailed reasoning
		**Impact**: High - Potential consequences
		**Mitigation**:
		
		- Immediate action required
		- Specific steps to take
		  **Testing Focus**: Specific test scenarios needed
		
		## Risk Distribution
		
		### By Category
		
		- Security: X risks (Y critical)
		- Performance: X risks (Y critical)
		- Data: X risks (Y critical)
		- Business: X risks (Y critical)
		- Operational: X risks (Y critical)
		
		### By Component
		
		- Frontend: X risks
		- Backend: X risks
		- Database: X risks
		- Infrastructure: X risks
		
		## Detailed Risk Register
		
		[Full table of all risks with scores and mitigations]
		
		## Risk-Based Testing Strategy
		
		### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
		
		- Test scenarios for critical risks
		- Required test types (security, load, chaos)
		- Test data requirements
		
		### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
		
		- Integration test scenarios
		- Edge case coverage
		
		### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
		
		- Standard functional tests
		- Regression test suite
		
		## Risk Acceptance Criteria
		
		### Must Fix Before Production
		
		- All critical risks (score 9)
		- High risks affecting security/data
		
		### Can Deploy with Mitigation
		
		- Medium risks with compensating controls
		- Low risks with monitoring in place
		
		### Accepted Risks
		
		- Document any risks team accepts
		- Include sign-off from appropriate authority
		
		## Monitoring Requirements
		
		Post-deployment monitoring for:
		
		- Performance metrics for PERF risks
		- Security alerts for SEC risks
		- Error rates for operational risks
		- Business KPIs for business risks
		
		## Risk Review Triggers
		
		Review and update risk profile when:
		
		- Architecture changes significantly
		- New integrations added
		- Security vulnerabilities discovered
		- Performance issues reported
		- Regulatory requirements change
		```
		
		## Risk Scoring Algorithm
		
		Calculate overall story risk score:
		
		```text
		Base Score = 100
		For each risk:
		  - Critical (9): Deduct 20 points
		  - High (6): Deduct 10 points
		  - Medium (4): Deduct 5 points
		  - Low (2-3): Deduct 2 points
		
		Minimum score = 0 (extremely risky)
		Maximum score = 100 (minimal risk)
		```
		
		## Risk-Based Recommendations
		
		Based on risk profile, recommend:
		
		1. **Testing Priority**
		   - Which tests to run first
		   - Additional test types needed
		   - Test environment requirements
		
		2. **Development Focus**
		   - Code review emphasis areas
		   - Additional validation needed
		   - Security controls to implement
		
		3. **Deployment Strategy**
		   - Phased rollout for high-risk changes
		   - Feature flags for risky features
		   - Rollback procedures
		
		4. **Monitoring Setup**
		   - Metrics to track
		   - Alerts to configure
		   - Dashboard requirements
		
		## Integration with Quality Gates
		
		**Deterministic gate mapping:**
		
		- Any risk with score ≥ 9 → Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
		- Else if any score ≥ 6 → Gate = CONCERNS
		- Else → Gate = PASS
		- Unmitigated risks → Document in gate
		
		### Output 3: Story Hook Line
		
		**Print this line for review task to quote:**
		
		```text
		Risk profile: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-risk-{YYYYMMDD}.md
		```
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- Identify risks early and systematically
		- Use consistent probability × impact scoring
		- Provide actionable mitigation strategies
		- Link risks to specific test requirements
		- Track residual risk after mitigation
		- Update risk profile as story evolves]]></file>

		# /shard-doc Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Document Sharding Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
		- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
		- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting
		
		## Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree
		
		[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.
		
		If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.
		
		If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:
		
		1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
		2. Or set markdownExploder to false in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml
		
		**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"
		
		If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:
		
		1. Set markdownExploder to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml
		2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
		
		I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."
		
		Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]
		
		### Installation and Usage
		
		1. **Install globally**:
		
		   ```bash
		   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
		   ```
		
		2. **Use the explode command**:
		
		   ```bash
		   # For PRD
		   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd
		
		   # For Architecture
		   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture
		
		   # For any document
		   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
		   ```
		
		3. **What it does**:
		   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
		   - Creates properly named files
		   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
		   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown
		
		If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.
		
		---
		
		## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)
		
		### Task Instructions
		
		1. Identify Document and Target Location
		
		- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
		- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
		- Example: `docs/prd.md` → create folder `docs/prd/`
		
		2. Parse and Extract Sections
		
		CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:
		
		1. Read the entire document content
		2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
		3. For each level 2 section:
		   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
		   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
		   - Be extremely careful with:
		     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
		     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
		     - Nested markdown elements
		     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks
		
		CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]
		
		### 3. Create Individual Files
		
		For each extracted section:
		
		1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case
		   - Remove special characters
		   - Replace spaces with dashes
		   - Example: "## Tech Stack" → `tech-stack.md`
		
		2. **Adjust heading levels**:
		   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
		   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:
		
		   ```txt
		     - ### → ##
		     - #### → ###
		     - ##### → ####
		     - etc.
		   ```
		
		3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file
		
		### 4. Create Index File
		
		Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:
		
		1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
		2. Lists all the sharded files with links:
		
		```markdown
		# Original Document Title
		
		[Original introduction content if any]
		
		## Sections
		
		- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
		- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
		- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
		  ...
		```
		
		### 5. Preserve Special Content
		
		1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:
		
		   ```language
		   content
		   ```
		
		2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:
		
		   ```mermaid
		   graph TD
		   ...
		   ```
		
		3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting
		
		4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting
		
		5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks
		
		6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact
		
		7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly
		
		### 6. Validation
		
		After sharding:
		
		1. Verify all sections were extracted
		2. Check that no content was lost
		3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
		4. Confirm all files were created successfully
		
		### 7. Report Results
		
		Provide a summary:
		
		```text
		Document sharded successfully:
		- Source: [original document path]
		- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
		- Files created: [count]
		- Sections:
		  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
		  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
		  ...
		```
		
		## Important Notes
		
		- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
		- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
		- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
		- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)]]></file>
	<file path='.claude\commands\BMad\tasks\test-design.md'><![CDATA[
		# /test-design Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# test-design
		
		Create comprehensive test scenarios with appropriate test level recommendations for story implementation.
		
		## Inputs
		
		```yaml
		required:
		  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
		  - story_path: '{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md' # Path from core-config.yaml
		  - story_title: '{title}' # If missing, derive from story file H1
		  - story_slug: '{slug}' # If missing, derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated)
		```
		
		## Purpose
		
		Design a complete test strategy that identifies what to test, at which level (unit/integration/e2e), and why. This ensures efficient test coverage without redundancy while maintaining appropriate test boundaries.
		
		## Dependencies
		
		```yaml
		data:
		  - test-levels-framework.md # Unit/Integration/E2E decision criteria
		  - test-priorities-matrix.md # P0/P1/P2/P3 classification system
		```
		
		## Process
		
		### 1. Analyze Story Requirements
		
		Break down each acceptance criterion into testable scenarios. For each AC:
		
		- Identify the core functionality to test
		- Determine data variations needed
		- Consider error conditions
		- Note edge cases
		
		### 2. Apply Test Level Framework
		
		**Reference:** Load `test-levels-framework.md` for detailed criteria
		
		Quick rules:
		
		- **Unit**: Pure logic, algorithms, calculations
		- **Integration**: Component interactions, DB operations
		- **E2E**: Critical user journeys, compliance
		
		### 3. Assign Priorities
		
		**Reference:** Load `test-priorities-matrix.md` for classification
		
		Quick priority assignment:
		
		- **P0**: Revenue-critical, security, compliance
		- **P1**: Core user journeys, frequently used
		- **P2**: Secondary features, admin functions
		- **P3**: Nice-to-have, rarely used
		
		### 4. Design Test Scenarios
		
		For each identified test need, create:
		
		```yaml
		test_scenario:
		  id: '{epic}.{story}-{LEVEL}-{SEQ}'
		  requirement: 'AC reference'
		  priority: P0|P1|P2|P3
		  level: unit|integration|e2e
		  description: 'What is being tested'
		  justification: 'Why this level was chosen'
		  mitigates_risks: ['RISK-001'] # If risk profile exists
		```
		
		### 5. Validate Coverage
		
		Ensure:
		
		- Every AC has at least one test
		- No duplicate coverage across levels
		- Critical paths have multiple levels
		- Risk mitigations are addressed

		## Quality Checklist
		
		Before finalizing, verify:
		
		- [ ] Every AC has test coverage
		- [ ] Test levels are appropriate (not over-testing)
		- [ ] No duplicate coverage across levels
		- [ ] Priorities align with business risk
		- [ ] Test IDs follow naming convention
		- [ ] Scenarios are atomic and independent
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- **Shift left**: Prefer unit over integration, integration over E2E
		- **Risk-based**: Focus on what could go wrong
		- **Efficient coverage**: Test once at the right level
		- **Maintainability**: Consider long-term test maintenance
		- **Fast feedback**: Quick tests run first]]></file>

		# /trace-requirements Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# trace-requirements
		
		Map story requirements to test cases using Given-When-Then patterns for comprehensive traceability.
		
		## Purpose
		
		Create a requirements traceability matrix that ensures every acceptance criterion has corresponding test coverage. This task helps identify gaps in testing and ensures all requirements are validated.
		
		**IMPORTANT**: Given-When-Then is used here for documenting the mapping between requirements and tests, NOT for writing the actual test code. Tests should follow your project's testing standards (no BDD syntax in test code).
		
		## Prerequisites
		
		- Story file with clear acceptance criteria
		- Access to test files or test specifications
		- Understanding of the implementation
		
		## Traceability Process
		
		### 1. Extract Requirements
		
		Identify all testable requirements from:
		
		- Acceptance Criteria (primary source)
		- User story statement
		- Tasks/subtasks with specific behaviors
		- Non-functional requirements mentioned
		- Edge cases documented
		
		### 2. Map to Test Cases
		
		For each requirement, document which tests validate it. Use Given-When-Then to describe what the test validates (not how it's written):
		
		```yaml
		requirement: 'AC1: User can login with valid credentials'
		test_mappings:
		  - test_file: 'auth/login.test.ts'
		    test_case: 'should successfully login with valid email and password'
		    # Given-When-Then describes WHAT the test validates, not HOW it's coded
		    given: 'A registered user with valid credentials'
		    when: 'They submit the login form'
		    then: 'They are redirected to dashboard and session is created'
		    coverage: full
		
		  - test_file: 'e2e/auth-flow.test.ts'
		    test_case: 'complete login flow'
		    given: 'User on login page'
		    when: 'Entering valid credentials and submitting'
		    then: 'Dashboard loads with user data'
		    coverage: integration
		```
		
		### 3. Coverage Analysis
		
		Evaluate coverage for each requirement:
		
		**Coverage Levels:**
		
		- `full`: Requirement completely tested
		- `partial`: Some aspects tested, gaps exist
		- `none`: No test coverage found
		- `integration`: Covered in integration/e2e tests only
		- `unit`: Covered in unit tests only
		
		### 4. Gap Identification
		
		Document any gaps found:
		
		```yaml
		coverage_gaps:
		  - requirement: 'AC3: Password reset email sent within 60 seconds'
		    gap: 'No test for email delivery timing'
		    severity: medium
		    suggested_test:
		      type: integration
		      description: 'Test email service SLA compliance'
		
		  - requirement: 'AC5: Support 1000 concurrent users'
		    gap: 'No load testing implemented'
		    severity: high
		    suggested_test:
		      type: performance
		      description: 'Load test with 1000 concurrent connections'

		```markdown
		# Requirements Traceability Matrix
		
		## Story: {epic}.{story} - {title}
		
		### Coverage Summary
		
		- Total Requirements: X
		- Fully Covered: Y (Z%)
		- Partially Covered: A (B%)
		- Not Covered: C (D%)
		
		### Requirement Mappings
		
		#### AC1: {Acceptance Criterion 1}
		
		**Coverage: FULL**
		
		Given-When-Then Mappings:
		
		- **Unit Test**: `auth.service.test.ts::validateCredentials`
		  - Given: Valid user credentials
		  - When: Validation method called
		  - Then: Returns true with user object
		
		- **Integration Test**: `auth.integration.test.ts::loginFlow`
		  - Given: User with valid account
		  - When: Login API called
		  - Then: JWT token returned and session created
		
		#### AC2: {Acceptance Criterion 2}
		
		**Coverage: PARTIAL**
		
		[Continue for all ACs...]
		
		### Critical Gaps
		
		1. **Performance Requirements**
		   - Gap: No load testing for concurrent users
		   - Risk: High - Could fail under production load
		   - Action: Implement load tests using k6 or similar
		
		2. **Security Requirements**
		   - Gap: Rate limiting not tested
		   - Risk: Medium - Potential DoS vulnerability
		   - Action: Add rate limit tests to integration suite
		
		### Test Design Recommendations
		
		Based on gaps identified, recommend:
		
		1. Additional test scenarios needed
		2. Test types to implement (unit/integration/e2e/performance)
		3. Test data requirements
		4. Mock/stub strategies
		
		### Risk Assessment
		
		- **High Risk**: Requirements with no coverage
		- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with only partial coverage
		- **Low Risk**: Requirements with full unit + integration coverage
		```
		
		## Traceability Best Practices
		
		### Given-When-Then for Mapping (Not Test Code)
		
		Use Given-When-Then to document what each test validates:
		
		**Given**: The initial context the test sets up
		
		- What state/data the test prepares
		- User context being simulated
		- System preconditions
		
		**When**: The action the test performs
		
		- What the test executes
		- API calls or user actions tested
		- Events triggered
		
		**Then**: What the test asserts
		
		- Expected outcomes verified
		- State changes checked
		- Values validated
		
		**Note**: This is for documentation only. Actual test code follows your project's standards (e.g., describe/it blocks, no BDD syntax).
		
		### Coverage Priority
		
		Prioritize coverage based on:
		
		1. Critical business flows
		2. Security-related requirements
		3. Data integrity requirements
		4. User-facing features
		5. Performance SLAs
		
		### Test Granularity
		
		Map at appropriate levels:
		
		- Unit tests for business logic
		- Integration tests for component interaction
		- E2E tests for user journeys
		- Performance tests for NFRs
		
		## Quality Indicators
		
		Good traceability shows:
		
		- Every AC has at least one test
		- Critical paths have multiple test levels
		- Edge cases are explicitly covered
		- NFRs have appropriate test types
		- Clear Given-When-Then for each test
		
		## Red Flags
		
		Watch for:
		
		- ACs with no test coverage
		- Tests that don't map to requirements
		- Vague test descriptions
		- Missing edge case coverage
		- NFRs without specific tests
		
		## Integration with Gates
		
		This traceability feeds into quality gates:
		
		- Critical gaps → FAIL
		- Minor gaps → CONCERNS
		- Missing P0 tests from test-design → CONCERNS
		
		### Output 3: Story Hook Line
		
		**Print this line for review task to quote:**
		
		```text
		Trace matrix: qa.qaLocation/assessments/{epic}.{story}-trace-{YYYYMMDD}.md
		```
		
		- Full coverage → PASS contribution
		
		## Key Principles
		
		- Every requirement must be testable
		- Use Given-When-Then for clarity
		- Identify both presence and absence
		- Prioritize based on risk
		- Make recommendations actionable]]></file>

		# /validate-next-story Task
		
		When this command is used, execute the following task:
		
		<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->
		
		# Validate Next Story Task
		
		## Purpose
		
		To comprehensively validate a story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient context for successful development. This task identifies issues and gaps that need to be addressed, preventing hallucinations and ensuring implementation readiness.
		
		## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)
		
		### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs
		
		- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`
		- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story validation."
		- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`
		- Identify and load the following inputs:
		  - **Story file**: The drafted story to validate (provided by user or discovered in `devStoryLocation`)
		  - **Parent epic**: The epic containing this story's requirements
		  - **Architecture documents**: Based on configuration (sharded or monolithic)
		  - **Story template**: `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` for completeness validation
		
		### 1. Template Completeness Validation
		
		- Load `bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.md` and extract all section headings from the template
		- **Missing sections check**: Compare story sections against template sections to verify all required sections are present
		- **Placeholder validation**: Ensure no template placeholders remain unfilled (e.g., `{{EpicNum}}`, `{{role}}`, `_TBD_`)
		- **Agent section verification**: Confirm all sections from template exist for future agent use
		- **Structure compliance**: Verify story follows template structure and formatting
		
		### 2. File Structure and Source Tree Validation
		
		- **File paths clarity**: Are new/existing files to be created/modified clearly specified?
		- **Source tree relevance**: Is relevant project structure included in Dev Notes?
		- **Directory structure**: Are new directories/components properly located according to project structure?
		- **File creation sequence**: Do tasks specify where files should be created in logical order?
		- **Path accuracy**: Are file paths consistent with project structure from architecture docs?
		
		### 3. UI/Frontend Completeness Validation (if applicable)
		
		- **Component specifications**: Are UI components sufficiently detailed for implementation?
		- **Styling/design guidance**: Is visual implementation guidance clear?
		- **User interaction flows**: Are UX patterns and behaviors specified?
		- **Responsive/accessibility**: Are these considerations addressed if required?
		- **Integration points**: Are frontend-backend integration points clear?
		
		### 4. Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction Assessment
		
		- **AC coverage**: Will all acceptance criteria be satisfied by the listed tasks?
		- **AC testability**: Are acceptance criteria measurable and verifiable?
		- **Missing scenarios**: Are edge cases or error conditions covered?
		- **Success definition**: Is "done" clearly defined for each AC?
		- **Task-AC mapping**: Are tasks properly linked to specific acceptance criteria?
		
		### 5. Validation and Testing Instructions Review
		
		- **Test approach clarity**: Are testing methods clearly specified?
		- **Test scenarios**: Are key test cases identified?
		- **Validation steps**: Are acceptance criteria validation steps clear?
		- **Testing tools/frameworks**: Are required testing tools specified?
		- **Test data requirements**: Are test data needs identified?
		
		### 6. Security Considerations Assessment (if applicable)
		
		- **Security requirements**: Are security needs identified and addressed?
		- **Authentication/authorization**: Are access controls specified?
		- **Data protection**: Are sensitive data handling requirements clear?
		- **Vulnerability prevention**: Are common security issues addressed?
		- **Compliance requirements**: Are regulatory/compliance needs addressed?
		
		### 7. Tasks/Subtasks Sequence Validation
		
		- **Logical order**: Do tasks follow proper implementation sequence?
		- **Dependencies**: Are task dependencies clear and correct?
		- **Granularity**: Are tasks appropriately sized and actionable?
		- **Completeness**: Do tasks cover all requirements and acceptance criteria?
		- **Blocking issues**: Are there any tasks that would block others?
		
		### 8. Anti-Hallucination Verification
		
		- **Source verification**: Every technical claim must be traceable to source documents
		- **Architecture alignment**: Dev Notes content matches architecture specifications
		- **No invented details**: Flag any technical decisions not supported by source documents
		- **Reference accuracy**: Verify all source references are correct and accessible
		- **Fact checking**: Cross-reference claims against epic and architecture documents
		
		### 9. Dev Agent Implementation Readiness
		
		- **Self-contained context**: Can the story be implemented without reading external docs?
		- **Clear instructions**: Are implementation steps unambiguous?
		- **Complete technical context**: Are all required technical details present in Dev Notes?
		- **Missing information**: Identify any critical information gaps
		- **Actionability**: Are all tasks actionable by a development agent?
		
		### 10. Generate Validation Report
		
		Provide a structured validation report including:
		
		#### Template Compliance Issues
		
		- Missing sections from story template
		- Unfilled placeholders or template variables
		- Structural formatting issues
		
		#### Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)
		
		- Missing essential information for implementation
		- Inaccurate or unverifiable technical claims
		- Incomplete acceptance criteria coverage
		- Missing required sections
		
		#### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)
		
		- Unclear implementation guidance
		- Missing security considerations
		- Task sequencing problems
		- Incomplete testing instructions
		
		#### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)
		
		- Additional context that would help implementation
		- Clarifications that would improve efficiency
		- Documentation improvements
		
		#### Anti-Hallucination Findings
		
		- Unverifiable technical claims
		- Missing source references
		- Inconsistencies with architecture documents
		- Invented libraries, patterns, or standards
		
		#### Final Assessment
		
		- **GO**: Story is ready for implementation
		- **NO-GO**: Story requires fixes before implementation
		- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 1-10 scale
		- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low for successful implementation]]></file>

		# UX-EXPERT Agent Rule
		
		This rule is triggered when the user types `*ux-expert` and activates the UX Expert agent persona.
		
		## Agent Activation
		
		CRITICAL: Read the full YAML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
		
		```yaml
		IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
		  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
		  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
		  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
		  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
		  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
		REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
		activation-instructions:
		  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
		  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
		  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
		  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
		  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
		  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
		  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
		  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
		  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
		  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
		  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
		  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
		  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

		## File Reference
		
		The complete agent definition is available in [.bmad-core/agents/bmad-master.md](.bmad-core/agents/bmad-master.md).
		
		## Usage

		# ARCHITECT Agent Rule
		
		This rule is triggered when the user types `*architect` and activates the Architect agent persona.
		
		## Agent Activation
		
		CRITICAL: Read the full YAML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
		
		```yaml
		IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
		  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
		  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
		  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
		  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
		  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
		REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
		activation-instructions:
		  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
		  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
		  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
		  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
		  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
		  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
		  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
		  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
		  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
		  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
		  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
		  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
		  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

		ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
		
		CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
		
		## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
		
		```yaml
		IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
		  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
		  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
		  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
		  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
		  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
		REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
		activation-instructions:
		  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
		  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
		  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
		  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
		  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
		  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
		  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
		  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
		  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
		  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
		  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
		  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
		  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

		# BMad Web Orchestrator
		
		ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
		
		CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
		
		## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
		
		```yaml
		IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
		  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
		  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
		  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
		  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
		  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
		REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
		activation-instructions:
		  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
		  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
		  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
		  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
		  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
		  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
		  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
		  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
		  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
		  - Announce: Introduce yourself as the BMad Orchestrator, explain you can coordinate agents and workflows
		  - IMPORTANT: Tell users that all commands start with * (e.g., `*help`, `*agent`, `*workflow`)
		  - Assess user goal against available agents and workflows in this bundle
		  - If clear match to an agent's expertise, suggest transformation with *agent command
		  - If project-oriented, suggest *workflow-guidance to explore options
		  - Load resources only when needed - never pre-load (Exception: Read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` during activation)
		  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

		    - Never pre-load resources - discover and load at runtime
		    - Assess needs and recommend best approach/agent/workflow
		    - Track current state and guide to next logical steps
		    - When embodied, specialized persona's principles take precedence
		    - Be explicit about active persona and current task
		    - Always use numbered lists for choices
		    - Process commands starting with * immediately
		    - Always remind users that commands require * prefix
		commands: # All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help, *agent pm)
		  help: Show this guide with available agents and workflows
		  agent: Transform into a specialized agent (list if name not specified)

		    Key deliverables: {main outputs/documents}]
		
		  === Available Workflows ===
		  [Dynamically list each workflow in bundle with format:
		  *workflow {id}: {name}
		    Purpose: {description}]
		
		  💡 Tip: Each agent has unique tasks, templates, and checklists. Switch to an agent to access their capabilities!
		
		fuzzy-matching:
		  - 85% confidence threshold
		  - Show numbered list if unsure
		transformation:
		  - Match name/role to agents
		  - Announce transformation
		  - Operate until exit
		loading:
		  - KB: Only for *kb-mode or BMad questions
		  - Agents: Only when transforming
		  - Templates/Tasks: Only when executing
		  - Always indicate loading
		kb-mode-behavior:
		  - When *kb-mode is invoked, use kb-mode-interaction task
		  - Don't dump all KB content immediately
		  - Present topic areas and wait for user selection
		  - Provide focused, contextual responses
		workflow-guidance:
		  - Discover available workflows in the bundle at runtime
		  - Understand each workflow's purpose, options, and decision points
		  - Ask clarifying questions based on the workflow's structure
		  - Guide users through workflow selection when multiple options exist
		  - When appropriate, suggest: 'Would you like me to create a detailed workflow plan before starting?'
		  - For workflows with divergent paths, help users choose the right path
		  - Adapt questions to the specific domain (e.g., game dev vs infrastructure vs web dev)
		  - Only recommend workflows that actually exist in the current bundle
		  - When *workflow-guidance is called, start an interactive session and list all available workflows with brief descriptions

		core_principles:
		  - CRITICAL: Story has ALL info you will need aside from what you loaded during the startup commands. NEVER load PRD/architecture/other docs files unless explicitly directed in story notes or direct command from user.
		  - CRITICAL: ALWAYS check current folder structure before starting your story tasks, don't create new working directory if it already exists. Create new one when you're sure it's a brand new project.
		  - CRITICAL: ONLY update story file Dev Agent Record sections (checkboxes/Debug Log/Completion Notes/Change Log)

		  - develop-story:
		      - order-of-execution: 'Read (first or next) task→Implement Task and its subtasks→Write tests→Execute validations→Only if ALL pass, then update the task checkbox with [x]→Update story section File List to ensure it lists and new or modified or deleted source file→repeat order-of-execution until complete'
		      - story-file-updates-ONLY:
		          - CRITICAL: ONLY UPDATE THE STORY FILE WITH UPDATES TO SECTIONS INDICATED BELOW. DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER SECTIONS.

		          - CRITICAL: DO NOT modify Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Testing sections, or any other sections not listed above
		      - blocking: 'HALT for: Unapproved deps needed, confirm with user | Ambiguous after story check | 3 failures attempting to implement or fix something repeatedly | Missing config | Failing regression'
		      - ready-for-review: 'Code matches requirements + All validations pass + Follows standards + File List complete'

		ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines. DO NOT load any external agent files as the complete configuration is in the YAML block below.
		
		CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS IN THIS FILE to understand your operating params, start and follow exactly your activation-instructions to alter your state of being, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:
		
		## COMPLETE AGENT DEFINITION FOLLOWS - NO EXTERNAL FILES NEEDED
		
		```yaml
		IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
		  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
		  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
		  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
		  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
		  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
		REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
		activation-instructions:
		  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
		  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
		  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
		  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
		  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
		  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
		  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
		  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
		  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
		  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
		  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
		  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
		  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

		# Временные заглушки и TODO для будущих исправлений
		
		## Story 2.3: Personal Cabinet API
		
		### Временные заглушки требующие исправления:
		
		#### 1. UserDashboardView - заглушки для статистики заказов
		**Файл:** `apps/users/views.py` - UserDashboardView.get()
		**Заглушки:**
		```python
		'orders_count': 0,  # Будет реализовано после создания Order модели
		'total_order_amount': 0,  # Временно 0  
		'avg_order_amount': 0,    # Временно 0
		```
		**Требует:** Реализации Order модели в apps/orders/models.py
		
		#### 2. OrderHistoryView - полная заглушка
		**Файл:** `apps/users/views.py` - OrderHistoryView.get()
		**Заглушка:**
		```python
		return Response({
		    'count': 0,
		    'next': None, 
		    'previous': None,
		    'results': []
		}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
		```
		**Требует:** 
		- Реализации Order модели
		- Подключения к реальным данным заказов
		- Фильтрации по статусу и датам
		
		#### 3. OrderHistorySerializer - заглушка serializer
		**Файл:** `apps/users/serializers.py` - OrderHistorySerializer
		**Статус:** Базовая структура создана, но не подключена к реальной модели
		**Требует:** Обновления после создания Order модели
		
		### Зависимости для исправления:
		
		1. **Order модель** должна содержать поля:
		   - id, order_number, status, total_amount, created_at, updated_at
		   - связь с User через ForeignKey
		   - связь с OrderItem для подсчета items_count
		
		2. **OrderItem модель** для подсчета товаров в заказе
		
		3. **Агрегация данных** для дашборда:
		   - COUNT заказов пользователя  
		   - SUM общей суммы заказов
		   - AVG средней суммы заказа
		
		### Статус исправления:
		✅ **ГОТОВО К ИСПРАВЛЕНИЮ** - Story 2.7: Order API завершена 17 августа 2025
		
		**Order модель реализована** в `apps/orders/models.py`:
		- ✅ Все необходимые поля созданы: id, order_number, status, total_amount, created_at, updated_at
		- ✅ ForeignKey связь с User установлена
		- ✅ OrderItem модель создана для подсчета товаров в заказе
		- ✅ Computed properties реализованы: total_items, calculated_total
		
		**Готовые компоненты для интеграции:**
		- ✅ `Order.objects.filter(user=user)` - фильтрация заказов по пользователю
		- ✅ `order.total_items` - количество товаров в заказе  
		- ✅ `order.calculated_total` - рассчитанная сумма заказа
		- ✅ Агрегация доступна через Django ORM
		
		**Следующий шаг:** Обновить заглушки в UserDashboardView и OrderHistoryView
		
		### Поиск заглушек:
		```bash
		# Поиск всех временных заглушек
		grep -r "Будет реализовано" backend/apps/users/
		grep -r "Временно" backend/apps/users/
		grep -r "заглушка" backend/apps/users/
		```</file>

		## **Архитектура проекта**
		
		FREESPORT \- API-First E-commerce платформа для B2B/B2C продаж спортивных товаров. Monorepo архитектура с Django REST API backend и Next.js frontend.
		
		### **Технологический стек**
		
		**Backend:**
		
		* Django 4.2 LTS \+ Django REST Framework 3.14+  
		* PostgreSQL 15+ (база данных с поддержкой партиционирования и JSONB)  
		* Redis 7.0+ (кэширование и сессии)  
		* JWT токены для аутентификации с refresh стратегией  
		* Celery \+ Celery Beat (асинхронные задачи и планировщик)  
		* **drf-spectacular** для спецификации OpenAPI 3.1.0
		
		**Frontend:**
		
		* Next.js 14+ \+ TypeScript 5.0+  
		* React 19.1.0  
		* Zustand (state management)  
		* Tailwind CSS 4.0  
		* **React Hook Form** (управление формами)  
		* **Jest \+ React Testing Library** (тестирование)
		
		**Инфраструктура:**
		
		* Nginx (reverse proxy, SSL, load balancing)  
		* Docker \+ Docker Compose  
		* PostgreSQL с JSONB поддержкой для спецификаций товаров  
		* **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
		
		### **Архитектурные принципы**
		
		**API-First \+ SSR/SSG Approach:**
		
		* Обеспечивает SEO оптимизацию и производительность  
		* Независимая разработка frontend и backend  
		* Next.js Hybrid Rendering: SSG для статических страниц, SSR для динамических, ISR для каталогов
		
		**BFF (Backend for Frontend) Layer:**
		
		* Next.js API Routes как прослойка для агрегации данных  
		* Дополнительная безопасность между клиентом и основным API
		
		**Monorepo Structure:**
		
		* Упрощает управление общими компонентами между брендами  
		* Централизованная конфигурация и зависимости
		
		### **Структура приложений Django**
		
		Проект использует модульную архитектуру Django apps:
		
		* apps/users/ \- пользователи и ролевая система (7 ролей: retail, wholesale\_level1-3, trainer, federation\_rep, admin)  
		* apps/products/ \- каталог товаров, бренды, категории с многоуровневым ценообразованием  
		* apps/orders/ \- система заказов с поддержкой B2B/B2C процессов  
		* apps/cart/ \- корзина покупок для авторизованных и гостевых пользователей  
		* apps/common/ \- общие утилиты, компоненты и аудит
		
		### **Ключевые модели данных**
		
		**User Model:**
		
		* 7 ролей пользователей с разными уровнями ценообразования  
		* Поддержка B2B полей (company\_name, tax\_id, verification)  
		* JWT аутентификация с refresh токенами
		
		**Product Model:**
		
		* Многоуровневое ценообразование (retail\_price, opt1-3\_price, trainer\_price, federation\_price)  
		* Информационные цены для B2B (RRP, MSRP)  
		* JSON спецификации товаров в поле specifications  
		* Интеграция с 1С через onec\_id  
		* Computed properties: is\_in\_stock, can\_be\_ordered
		
		**Order/OrderItem Models:**
		
		* Поддержка как B2B, так и B2C заказов  
		* Снимок данных о товаре на момент заказа  
		* Интеграция с платежными системами (YuKassa)  
		* Статусы заказов и аудиторский след
		
		## **Команды разработки и запуска**
		
		### **Docker**
		
		Рекомендуемый способ запуска проекта \- через Docker Compose.
		
		\# Сборка и запуск всех сервисов в фоновом режиме  
		docker-compose up \-d \--build
		
		\# Остановка и удаление всех сервисов  
		docker-compose down
		
		Будут запущены следующие сервисы:
		
		* db: база данных PostgreSQL  
		* redis: кэш Redis  
		* backend: API на Django  
		* frontend: приложение на Next.js  
		* nginx: reverse proxy Nginx
		
		### **Локальная разработка**
		
		**Backend (Django)**
		
		cd backend  
		\# Активация виртуального окружения  
		source venv/bin/activate  \# Linux/Mac  
		venv\\Scripts\\activate     \# Windows  
		\# Установка зависимостей  
		pip install \-r requirements.txt  
		\# Запуск сервера разработки  
		python manage.py runserver 8001  
		\# Запуск Celery (в отдельных терминалах)  
		celery \-A freesport worker \--loglevel=info  
		celery \-A freesport beat \--loglevel=info
		
		### **Важные правила работы с Python и виртуальным окружением**
		
		1. **Всегда проверять активацию виртуального окружения перед запуском Python:**
		   - Убедиться, что в терминале отображается `(venv)` или аналогичный индикатор
		   - При необходимости активировать окружение командой:
		     - Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
		     - Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
		
		2. **Обязательно обновлять requirements.txt после установки новых пакетов:**
		   ```bash
		   # После установки любых новых пакетов через pip install
		   pip freeze > requirements.txt
		   ```
		   - Это обеспечивает синхронизацию зависимостей между разработчиками
		   - Позволяет воспроизвести точную среду разработки
		
		**Frontend (Next.js)**
		
		cd frontend  
		\# Установка зависимостей  
		npm install  
		\# Запуск сервера разработки  
		npm run dev
		
		## **Процессы разработки**
		
		### **Git Workflow**
		
		* main \- продакшен ветка (защищена)  
		* develop \- основная ветка разработки (защищена)  
		* feature/\* \- ветки для новых функций  
		* hotfix/\* \- ветки для критических исправлений
		
		### **Стиль кода**
		
		**Backend**
		
		* **Форматирование:** Black  
		* **Линтинг:** Flake8  
		* **Сортировка импортов:** isort  
		* **Проверка типов:** mypy
		
		**Frontend**
		
		* **Линтинг:** ESLint  
		* **Стилизация:** Tailwind CSS
		
		### **Стратегия тестирования**
		
		Проект следует классической пирамиде тестирования: E2E \> Integration \> Unit.
		
		**Детальные стандарты и правила тестирования:** см. `backend/docs/testing-standards.md`
		
		**Основные команды тестирования:**
		
		\# Тестирование в Docker (рекомендуется)
		make test                    \# Все тесты с PostgreSQL + Redis
		make test-unit               \# Только unit-тесты  
		make test-integration        \# Только интеграционные тесты
		make test-fast               \# Без пересборки образов
		
		\# Локально
		pytest                       \# Все тесты
		pytest \-m unit              \# Unit-тесты
		pytest \-m integration       \# Интеграционные тесты
		pytest \--cov=apps           \# С покрытием кода
		
		**Требования к покрытию:** Общее \>= 70%, критические модули \>= 90%.
		
		### **Исправления Docker конфигурации (обновлено 23.08.2025)**
		
		**Ключевые исправления:**
		- ✅ Устранено противоречие БД между test.py (SQLite) и Docker (PostgreSQL)
		- ✅ Добавлены недостающие сервисы db и redis в docker-compose.test.yml
		- ✅ Создана nginx конфигурация для основной среды
		- ✅ Создан оптимизированный Dockerfile.test для тестирования
		- ✅ Исправлен конфликт портов: Django теперь на порту 8001 вместо 8000
		- ✅ Добавлен Makefile с удобными командами
		- ✅ Созданы скрипты автоматизации тестирования
		
		**Новые файлы:**
		- docker-compose.test.yml - полная тестовая среда с PostgreSQL и Redis
		- backend/Dockerfile.test - оптимизированный образ для тестирования  
		- docker/nginx/ - конфигурация Nginx reverse proxy
		- Makefile - команды для разработки и тестирования
		- scripts/test.* - скрипты запуска тестов для разных ОС
		
		### **Система изоляции тестов (добавлено 23.08.2025)**
		
		**Решенные проблемы:**
		- ✅ Устранены constraint violations из-за дублирующихся данных в тестах
		- ✅ Реализована полная изоляция между тестами через autouse фикстуры  
		- ✅ Создана система генерации абсолютно уникальных данных
		- ✅ Исправлены интеграционные тесты для работы с изолированными данными
		
		**Ключевые компоненты изоляции:**
		- **Автоочистка БД**: `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` с TRUNCATE CASCADE перед каждым тестом
		- **Уникальные данные**: `get_unique_suffix()` с timestamp + счетчик + UUID
		- **Factory Boy правила**: LazyFunction вместо статических значений и Sequence
		- **Pytest настройки**: `--create-db --nomigrations` для быстрой изоляции
		
		**Обязательные правила для разработчиков:** см. детальные примеры в `backend/docs/testing-standards.md` разделе 8.5
		
		**Результат внедрения:**
		- 🚀 100% стабильность тестов без flaky failures
		- ⚡ Высокая производительность через оптимизированную очистку
		- 🔄 Поддержка параллельного выполнения без конфликтов
		- 📊 Улучшение с 49 failed/256 passed до стабильных результатов
		
		## **Настройки и конфигурация**
		
		### **Настройки окружения**
		
		* **Настройки Django:** Модульная структура в backend/freesport/settings/ (base.py, development.py, production.py).  
		* **Переменные окружения:** Создайте .env файлы на основе .env.example для Backend и Frontend.  
		* **Кодировка для Windows:** Backend автоматически настраивает UTF-8 для консоли Windows.
		
		### **Важные файлы конфигурации**
		
		* backend/pytest.ini \- настройки тестирования pytest с маркерами  
		* backend/mypy.ini \- статическая типизация  
		* frontend/package.json \- Node.js зависимости  
		* frontend/jest.config.js \- настройки Jest  
		* docker-compose.yml \- конфигурация Docker
		
		## **Интеграции и внешние сервисы**
		
		* **ERP интеграция (1С):** Двусторонний обмен данными (товары, заказы, остатки) через Celery.  
		* **Платежные системы:** YuKassa для онлайн платежей.  
		* **Службы доставки:** Интеграция с API CDEK, Boxberry.</file>

		  - остальные: CartItemSerializer (отображение)
		- **Возврат:** Класс serializer
		
		**`perform_create()`**
		- **Цель:** Реализация логики объединения товаров (FR6.1)
		- **Логика:**
		  - Проверяет существование товара в корзине
		  - Если есть: увеличивает quantity
		  - Если нет: создает новый CartItem
		- **Сохраняет:** Результат в `self.cart_item`
		
		**`create()` - POST /cart/items/**
		- **Цель:** Добавить товар в корзину

		## 1. Введение
		
		# Введение
		
		## Обзор проекта
		
		**FREESPORT** - современная API-First платформа электронной коммерции, объединяющая 5 торговых марок в единой экосистеме B2B/B2C продаж. Проект реализует полнофункциональный интернет-магазин с акцентом на оптовые продажи для тренеров, спортивных федераций и дистрибьюторов.
		
		## Технический контекст
		
		**Architecture Pattern:** API-First (Headless) архитектура с SSR/SSG
		**Primary Technology Stack:** Django REST Framework + Next.js
		**Database:** PostgreSQL с поддержкой партиционирования
		**Integration Layer:** REST API + WebHooks + BFF (Backend for Frontend)
		**Authentication:** JWT токены с refresh стратегией
		
		## Соответствие бизнес-требованиям
		
		- **B2B Functionality:** 3-уровневая оптовая система ценообразования с поддержкой ролей: тренер и представитель федерации спорта
		- **B2C Integration:** Полный цикл розничных продаж с ЮКасса интеграцией  
		- **ERP Integration:** Двусторонний обмен данными с 1С (остатки, заказы, статусы)
		- **Multi-Brand Support:** 5 торговых марок в едином каталоге с возможностью расширения
		- **Scalability:** Монорепо структура для будущего расширения
		
		## Ключевые технические решения
		
		1. **API-First + SSR/SSG Approach:** Обеспечивает SEO оптимизацию, производительность и независимость разработки
		2. **Next.js Hybrid Rendering:** SSG для статических страниц, SSR для динамических, ISR для каталогов
		3. **BFF Layer:** Next.js API Routes как прослойка для агрегации данных и безопасности
		4. **Monorepo Structure:** Упрощает управление общими компонентами между брендами
		5. **PostgreSQL Choice:** Поддержка JSONB, full-text search, партиционирование для больших объемов данных
		4. **Django + DRF:** Зрелая экосистема с встроенной админ-панелью и ORM

		### Слой BFF (Backend for Frontend)
		
		Next.js API Routes служат как прослойка между frontend приложением и Django API, обеспечивая:
		
		#### Преимущества BFF:
		- **Агрегация данных**: Объединение данных от нескольких Django API endpoints
		- **Безопасность**: Скрытие sensitive API keys и tokens от клиента  
		- **Кэширование**: Server-side кэширование для улучшения производительности
		- **Трансформация данных**: Адаптация данных под нужды frontend компонентов
		
		#### BFF API Routes Structure:
		
		```typescript
		// /app/api/products/route.ts - Aggregated products with pricing
		import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
		
		export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
		  try {
		    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
		    const brand = searchParams.get('brand');
		    const category = searchParams.get('category');
		    
		    // Aggregate data from multiple Django endpoints
		    const [productsRes, pricingRes, inventoryRes] = await Promise.all([
		      fetch(`${process.env.DJANGO_API_URL}/products/?brand=${brand}&category=${category}`, {
		        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` }
		      }),
		      fetch(`${process.env.DJANGO_API_URL}/pricing/?brand=${brand}`),
		      fetch(`${process.env.DJANGO_API_URL}/inventory/`)
		    ]);
		
		    const products = await productsRes.json();
		    const pricing = await pricingRes.json();
		    const inventory = await inventoryRes.json();

		└── manage.py                         # Django CLI
		```
		
		#### Views Architecture Pattern (Реализовано в Story 2.3)
		
		**Модульная организация views для масштабируемости:**
		
		```python
		# apps/users/views/__init__.py - Экспорт для обратной совместимости
		from .authentication import UserRegistrationView, UserLoginView
		from .profile import UserProfileView  
		from .misc import user_roles_view
		from .personal_cabinet import UserDashboardView, AddressViewSet, FavoriteViewSet
		
		# apps/users/views/authentication.py - Аутентификация
		class UserRegistrationView(APIView):
		    """Регистрация с ролевой системой B2B/B2C"""
		    
		class UserLoginView(APIView):
		    """JWT аутентификация"""
		
		# apps/users/views/personal_cabinet.py - Личный кабинет
		class UserDashboardView(APIView):
		    """Агрегированная статистика пользователя"""
		    
		class AddressViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
		    """CRUD управление адресами с фильтрацией по пользователю"""
		    
		class FavoriteViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
		    """Управление избранными товарами"""
		```
		
		**Преимущества модульной структуры:**
		- **Разделение ответственности**: Каждый модуль отвечает за свою область
		- **Масштабируемость**: Легко добавлять новые endpoints без загромождения
		- **Тестируемость**: Изолированное тестирование каждого модуля
		- **Совместимость**: Сохранение существующих URL patterns через __init__.py
		
		#### State Management Strategy
		
		```typescript
		// User store (Zustand)
		interface UserStore {
		  user: User | null
		  userRole: UserRole
		  isAuthenticated: boolean
		  permissions: string[]
		}
		
		// Cart store с поддержкой B2B логики
		interface CartStore {
		  items: CartItem[]
		  userMode: 'b2c' | 'b2b'
		  minimumOrderAmount: number
		  bulkDiscounts: BulkDiscount[]
		}
		
		// UI state для модальных окон, уведомлений
		interface UIStore {
		  modals: ModalState[]
		  notifications: Notification[]
		  theme: 'b2c' | 'b2b'
		}
		```
		
		#### Responsive Design System
		
		```scss
		// Breakpoints (согласно front-end-spec.md)
		$breakpoints: (
		  xs: 0,           // Мобильные телефоны
		  sm: 576px,       // Большие телефоны  
		  md: 768px,       // Планшеты
		  lg: 992px,       // Небольшие ноутбуки
		  xl: 1200px,      // Большие экраны
		  xxl: 1400px      // Широкие мониторы
		);
		
		// Адаптивная типографика
		$text-base: clamp(1rem, 0.95rem + 0.25vw, 1.1rem);
		$text-lg: clamp(1.125rem, 1rem + 0.5vw, 1.25rem);
		```

		### Разграничение ответственности по слоям
		
		#### Nginx Gateway Layer:
		- **SSL Termination**: Let's Encrypt сертификаты
		- **Базовое Rate Limiting**: 1000 запросов/минуту с IP
		- **Static Files**: Раздача медиа файлов и статики
		- **Load Balancing**: Распределение между инстансами Django
		- **DDoS Protection**: Базовая защита от атак
		
		#### Next.js BFF Layer:
		- **JWT Authentication**: Валидация токенов и refresh logic
		- **Интеллектуальное Rate Limiting**: 
		  - 5 попыток логина/минуту для пользователя
		  - 10 заказов/день для розничных клиентов
		  - Разные лимиты для B2B пользователей
		- **Role-Based Access Control**: Проверка ролей и прав доступа
		- **Data Aggregation**: Объединение данных от нескольких API endpoints
		- **Request/Response трансформация**: Адаптация под frontend нужды
		
		#### Django API Layer:
		- **Business Logic**: Основная логика приложения
		- **Data Management**: CRUD операции с БД
		- **External Integrations**: 1C, платежи, доставка
		- **Admin Interface**: Django Admin для контент-менеджмента

		```
		
		**Обоснование решения:**
		- Django Admin для рутинных операций и быстрого прототипирования
		- Custom Admin для критичного UX и сложной бизнес-логики
		- Единое API, разные интерфейсы
		
		### Механизмы отказоустойчивости
		
		**1С Integration Resilience:**
		- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Автоматическое переключение на файловый обмен
		- **File-based Fallback**: Экспорт заказов в XML/JSON для ручной обработки
		- **Retry Logic**: Экспоненциальная задержка для повторных попыток
		
		**Payment Gateway Resilience:**
		- **Webhook Validation**: Криптографическая подпись YuKassa
		- **Idempotency Keys**: Предотвращение дублирования платежей
		- **Status Reconciliation**: Периодическая сверка статусов
		
		**Database Resilience:**
		- **Connection Pooling**: pgBouncer для оптимизации подключений
		- **Read Replicas**: Масштабирование чтения каталога товаров
		- **Backup Strategy**: Ежедневные инкрементальные бэкапы + WAL
		
		### Масштабируемость
		
		**Горизонтальное масштабирование:**
		- Django API servers (stateless)
		- Celery workers (по типам задач)  
		- Read-only replicas PostgreSQL
		- Redis Cluster для сессий и кэша
		
		**Вертикальное масштабирование:**
		- CPU для обработки изображений
		- RAM для кэширования товаров
		- Storage для медиа файлов

		#### Важные архитектурные решения
		
		**1. Композитный FOREIGN KEY для секционированных таблиц:**
		- `orders_orderitem` включает `order_created_at` для корректной работы с секционированной `orders_order`
		- Это обеспечивает referential integrity на уровне БД
		
		**2. Секционирование:**
		- `products_product` - по hash от `brand_id` для равномерного распределения
		- `orders_order` - по range от `created_at` для эффективного архивирования
		
		**3. Ценообразование:**
		- Multi-tier pricing с поддержкой всех типов пользователей
		- RRP/MSRP поля для B2B пользователей (требование FR5)
		
		**4. Соответствие ФЗ-152:**
		- Audit log с `ON DELETE SET NULL` для сохранения аудита
		- Система согласий (consent management)

		## 12. Стратегия Обработки Ошибок
		
		### Frontend Error Handling
		
		**React Error Boundaries:**
		- Global ErrorBoundary для перехвата React ошибок
		- Component-level fallbacks для graceful degradation
		- Automatic error reporting to monitoring service
		
		**API Error Handling:**
		```typescript
		interface ApiError {
		  message: string;
		  code: string;
		  details?: Record<string, any>;
		  status: number;
		}
		
		// User-friendly error messages
		const getErrorMessage = (error: ApiError): string => {
		  switch (error.code) {
		    case 'NETWORK_ERROR': return 'Проблемы с подключением к интернету';
		    case 'VALIDATION_ERROR': return 'Проверьте правильность заполнения полей';
		    case 'INSUFFICIENT_STOCK': return 'Товара нет в наличии';
		    case 'PAYMENT_FAILED': return 'Ошибка при обработке платежа';
		    default: return error.message || 'Произошла неизвестная ошибка';
		  }
		};
		```
		
		**Next.js Error Pages:**
		- Custom error.tsx для глобальных ошибок
		- not-found.tsx для 404 ошибок
		- API route error handling с proper HTTP codes
		
		### Backend Error Handling
		
		**Custom Exception Classes:**
		```python
		class FreeSportException(Exception):
		    default_message = "An error occurred"
		    default_code = "FREESPORT_ERROR"
		    default_status = status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
		
		class ValidationException(FreeSportException):
		    default_code = "VALIDATION_ERROR"
		    default_status = status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST
		
		class InsufficientStockException(FreeSportException):
		    default_code = "INSUFFICIENT_STOCK"
		    default_status = status.HTTP_409_CONFLICT
		
		class PaymentException(FreeSportException):
		    default_code = "PAYMENT_FAILED"
		    default_status = status.HTTP_402_PAYMENT_REQUIRED
		```
		
		**Global Exception Handler:**
		- Standardized error response format
		- Automatic logging for all exceptions
		- Different handling for custom vs system exceptions
		- Database error fallbacks
		
		**Service Layer Error Handling:**
		- Transactional integrity для критических операций
		- Graceful fallbacks для external service failures
		- Retry logic с exponential backoff
		
		### Circuit Breaker Pattern
		
		**External Service Protection:**
		- Circuit breaker для 1C интеграции
		- Failure threshold: 5 неудач
		- Recovery timeout: 60 секунд
		- Fallback to file export при недоступности API
		
		### Error Monitoring
		
		**Error Aggregation:**
		- Группировка одинаковых ошибок по hash
		- Count tracking для частоты ошибок
		- Resolution tracking для bug fixing
		
		**Alert System:**
		- Email alerts для critical errors
		- Slack integration для development team
		- Error rate monitoring и thresholds
		
		**Error Categories:**
		- Frontend errors (JavaScript/React)
		- Backend errors (Django/API)
		- Integration errors (1C/YuKassa)
		- Database errors (PostgreSQL)
		
		### Retry Strategies
		
		**Celery Tasks:**
		- Max 3 retries с exponential backoff
		- Different retry delays по типу ошибки
		- Final fallback mechanisms
		- Admin notifications при complete failure
		
		**API Calls:**
		- Network timeout: 30 секунд
		- Retry on 5xx errors (не на 4xx)
		- Client-side retry с user feedback
		
		---
		
		## 13. Мониторинг и Наблюдаемость
		
		### System Health Monitoring
		
		**Key Metrics:**
		- API response time (SLA: < 2 секунды)
		- Database query time (SLA: < 1 секунда)
		- Error rate (SLA: < 5%)
		- System uptime (SLA: 99.9%)
		- Resource utilization (CPU < 75%, Memory < 80%, Disk < 85%)
		
		**Health Check Endpoints:**
		```python
		# /api/v1/health/ - comprehensive health status
		{
		  "status": "healthy|unhealthy",
		  "version": "1.0.0",
		  "environment": "production",
		  "api": {
		    "database": {"healthy": true, "response_time": 0.05},
		    "cache": {"healthy": true, "response_time": 0.01},
		    "data": {"products_count": 15000, "orders_24h": 45}
		  },
		  "system": {
		    "cpu": {"usage_percent": 35.2, "healthy": true},
		    "memory": {"usage_percent": 68.5, "healthy": true},
		    "disk": {"usage_percent": 45.1, "healthy": true}
		  }
		}
		```
		
		### Business Metrics
		
		**Sales Analytics:**
		- Daily/weekly/monthly revenue tracking

		class MetricsCollector:
		    @staticmethod
		    def get_system_metrics():
		        return {
		            'cpu_percent': psutil.cpu_percent(),
		            'memory': psutil.virtual_memory()._asdict(),
		            'disk': psutil.disk_usage('/')._asdict(),
		            'timestamp': time.time()
		        }
		    
		    @staticmethod
		    def get_business_metrics():
		        return {
		            'daily_orders': Order.objects.filter(created_at__date=today).count(),
		            'daily_revenue': Order.objects.filter(
		                created_at__date=today, payment_status='completed'
		            ).aggregate(Sum('total_amount'))['total_amount__sum'] or 0
		        }
		```

		```yaml
		# Multi-service deployment with scaling
		django:
		  deploy:
		    replicas: 3
		    update_config:
		      parallelism: 1
		      delay: 30s
		      order: start-first
		      failure_action: rollback
		    resources:
		      limits:
		        memory: 512M
		        cpus: '0.5'
		```
		
		**Secrets Management:**

		4. **Build**: Multi-platform Docker images (AMD64/ARM64)
		5. **Deploy**: Environment-specific deployment strategies
		
		**Branch-based Triggers:**
		- Feature branches → validation tests only
		- Develop → full test suite + staging deploy
		- Main → production deployment
		- Pull requests → comprehensive validation
		
		### Deployment Automation
		
		**Smart Health Checks:**
		```bash
		wait_for_health_check() {
		  local max_attempts=${1:-30}
		  local attempt=1
		  
		  while [[ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]]; do
		    if curl -f "$HEALTH_CHECK_URL" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
		      echo "✅ Health check passed (attempt $attempt)"
		      return 0
		    fi
		    sleep 10
		    ((attempt++))
		  done
		  
		  echo "❌ Health check failed after $max_attempts attempts"
		  return 1
		}
		```
		
		**Rolling Updates:**
		- Zero-downtime deployments
		- Automatic rollback on failure
		- Progressive deployment (start-first strategy)
		- Service-specific update parallelism
		
		### Environment Management

		### Особенности API интеграции с 1С
		
		#### Аутентификация
		- **JWT Bearer Token**: Для пользовательских операций
		- **API Key**: Для интеграции с 1С системой
		
		#### Endpoints для синхронизации покупателей
		- `GET /api/1c/customers/` - Получение списка покупателей для синхронизации
		- `POST /api/1c/customers/` - Импорт покупателей из 1С
		- `PUT /api/1c/customers/{onec_id}/` - Обновление конкретного покупателя
		- `GET /api/1c/customers/{onec_id}/` - Получение покупателя по ID 1С
		
		#### Управление заказами
		- `GET /api/1c/orders/` - Получение заказов для экспорта в 1С
		- `POST /api/1c/orders/` - Обновление статусов заказов из 1С
		
		#### Управление конфликтами
		- `GET /api/1c/sync/conflicts/` - Список конфликтов синхронизации
		- `POST /api/1c/sync/conflicts/{id}/resolve/` - Разрешение конфликта
		
		#### Логирование и мониторинг
		- `GET /api/1c/sync/logs/` - Получение логов операций синхронизации
		
		#### Коды ответов
		- **200 OK**: Успешная операция
		- **201 Created**: Ресурс создан
		- **202 Accepted**: Операция принята к обработке (асинхронные операции)
		- **400 Bad Request**: Некорректный запрос
		- **401 Unauthorized**: Не авторизован
		- **403 Forbidden**: Доступ запрещен
		- **404 Not Found**: Ресурс не найден
		- **409 Conflict**: Конфликт данных при синхронизации
		- **500 Internal Server Error**: Внутренняя ошибка сервера
		
		#### Pagination
		Все endpoints с множественными результатами поддерживают pagination:
		- `page`: номер страницы (по умолчанию 1)
		- `page_size`: размер страницы (по умолчанию 20, максимум 200)
		
		#### Фильтрация
		Поддерживается фильтрация по:
		- Времени модификации (`modified_since`, `created_since`)
		- Статусу синхронизации (`sync_status`, `export_status`)
		- Типу операции (`operation_type`, `conflict_type`)
		- Статусу разрешения (`is_resolved`)</file>

		// Фильтры и сортировка
		interface SortOptionsProps {
		  options: SortOption[]
		  currentSort: string
		  mode: 'b2c' | 'b2b'

		### Разграничение ответственности по слоям
		
		#### Nginx Gateway Layer:
		- **SSL Termination**: Let's Encrypt сертификаты
		- **Базовое Rate Limiting**: 1000 запросов/минуту с IP
		- **Static Files**: Раздача медиа файлов и статики
		- **Load Balancing**: Распределение между инстансами Django
		- **DDoS Protection**: Базовая защита от атак
		
		#### Next.js BFF Layer:
		- **JWT Authentication**: Валидация токенов и refresh logic
		- **Интеллектуальное Rate Limiting**: 
		  - 5 попыток логина/минуту для пользователя
		  - 10 заказов/день для розничных клиентов
		  - Разные лимиты для B2B пользователей
		- **Role-Based Access Control**: Проверка ролей и прав доступа
		- **Data Aggregation**: Объединение данных от нескольких API endpoints
		- **Request/Response трансформация**: Адаптация под frontend нужды
		
		#### Django API Layer:
		- **Business Logic**: Основная логика приложения
		- **Data Management**: CRUD операции с БД
		- **External Integrations**: 1C, платежи, доставка
		- **Admin Interface**: Django Admin для контент-менеджмента
		
		### Стратегия админ-панели (гибридный подход)

		```
		
		**Обоснование решения:**
		- Django Admin для рутинных операций и быстрого прототипирования
		- Custom Admin для критичного UX и сложной бизнес-логики
		- Единое API, разные интерфейсы
		
		### Механизмы отказоустойчивости
		
		**1С Integration Resilience:**
		- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Автоматическое переключение на файловый обмен
		- **File-based Fallback**: Экспорт заказов в XML/JSON для ручной обработки
		- **Retry Logic**: Экспоненциальная задержка для повторных попыток
		
		**Payment Gateway Resilience:**
		- **Webhook Validation**: Криптографическая подпись YuKassa
		- **Idempotency Keys**: Предотвращение дублирования платежей
		- **Status Reconciliation**: Периодическая сверка статусов
		
		**Database Resilience:**
		- **Connection Pooling**: pgBouncer для оптимизации подключений
		- **Read Replicas**: Масштабирование чтения каталога товаров
		- **Backup Strategy**: Ежедневные инкрементальные бэкапы + WAL
		
		### Масштабируемость
		
		**Горизонтальное масштабирование:**
		- Django API servers (stateless)
		- Celery workers (по типам задач)  
		- Read-only replicas PostgreSQL
		- Redis Cluster для сессий и кэша
		
		**Вертикальное масштабирование:**
		- CPU для обработки изображений
		- RAM для кэширования товаров
		- Storage для медиа файлов

		# 7. Внешние Интеграции
		
		## Обзор интеграций
		
		FREESPORT платформа интегрируется с несколькими внешними системами для обеспечения полного цикла электронной коммерции:
		
		1. **1С:Управление торговлей** - ERP система для управления товарами, заказами и клиентами
		2. **ЮКасса** - платежная система для онлайн-оплаты
		3. **СДЭК/Boxberry** - службы доставки
		4. **Email/SMS сервисы** - уведомления и маркетинг
		
		---
		
		## 1. Интеграция с 1С:Управление торговлей
		
		### 1.1. Архитектурный обзор
		
		Двусторонняя интеграция с системой учета для синхронизации:
		- **Товары и цены** (из 1С → в платформу)
		- **Остатки товаров** (из 1С → в платформу)  
		- **Покупатели** (двусторонняя синхронизация)
		- **Заказы** (из платформы → в 1С)
		- **Статусы заказов** (из 1С → в платформу)
		
		### 1.2. Архитектура с Circuit Breaker Pattern

		```
		
		#### Важные архитектурные решения
		
		**1. Композитный FOREIGN KEY для секционированных таблиц:**
		- `orders_orderitem` включает `order_created_at` для корректной работы с секционированной `orders_order`
		- Это обеспечивает referential integrity на уровне БД
		
		**2. Секционирование:**
		- `products_product` - по hash от `brand_id` для равномерного распределения
		- `orders_order` - по range от `created_at` для эффективного архивирования
		
		**3. Ценообразование:**
		- Multi-tier pricing с поддержкой всех типов пользователей
		- RRP/MSRP поля для B2B пользователей (требование FR5)
		
		**4. Соответствие ФЗ-152:**
		- Audit log с `ON DELETE SET NULL` для сохранения аудита
		- Система согласий (consent management)

		# 10. Стратегия Тестирования
		
		## 10.1. Философия и принципы тестирования
		
		### Пирамида тестирования
		
		```
		                  E2E Tests (Playwright)
		                 /        \
		        Integration Tests (Pytest + APIClient)
		               /            \
		      Backend Unit Tests (Pytest)  Frontend Unit (Jest)
		```
		
		**Testing Philosophy:** Стратегия тестирования FREESPORT основана на классической пирамиде тестирования с упором на быстрые unit-тесты в основании и критически важные E2E тесты на вершине. Особое внимание уделяется полной изоляции тестов и их стабильности.
		
		### Технологический стек тестирования
		
		**Backend:**
		- **Основной фреймворк**: `pytest`
		- **Интеграция с Django**: `pytest-django`
		- **Генерация данных**: `Factory Boy`
		- **Мокинг (Mocking)**: `pytest-mock`
		- **Изоляция БД**: Транзакционные тесты с автоочисткой
		
		**Frontend:**
		- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
		- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
		- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking
		- **Jest Environment**: jsdom для браузерной среды
		
		**E2E:**
		- **Playwright**: Primary E2E framework
		- **TypeScript**: Type-safe test scripts
		- **Page Object Model**: Maintainable test structure
		- **Multiple Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari testing
		
		## 10.2. Организация и структура тестов
		
		### Backend Tests - Детальная структура

		### Типы тестов и их назначение
		
		#### 10.2.1. Unit-тесты (`tests/unit/`)
		
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование одного изолированного компонента (модели, сериализатора, сервиса, утилиты)
		- **Технологии**: `pytest`, `pytest-mock`
		- **Особенности**: НЕ обращаются к базе данных или внешним сервисам
		- **Маркировка**: `@pytest.mark.unit`
		- **Пример**: Проверка метода модели `Product.can_be_ordered()` возвращает `False` при `stock_quantity = 0`
		
		#### 10.2.2. Интеграционные тесты (`tests/integration/`)
		
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование взаимодействия между несколькими компонентами системы
		- **Технологии**: `pytest`, `pytest-django`, `APIClient`, `Factory Boy`
		- **Особенности**: Используют тестовую БД, проверяют полный цикл "запрос-ответ" для API
		- **Маркировка**: `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.django_db`
		- **Пример**: POST-запрос на `/api/v1/orders/`, проверка создания заказа в БД и корректности ответа
		
		#### 10.2.3. E2E-тесты (внешняя директория `e2e/`)
		
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование полных пользовательских сценариев через браузер
		- **Технологии**: `Playwright`
		- **Пример**: "Пользователь логинится, добавляет товар в корзину, оформляет заказ"
		
		#### 10.2.4. Устаревшие тесты (`tests/legacy/`)
		
		**⚠️ ВАЖНО**: 
		- Содержат тесты для устаревшего функционала
		- **НЕ запускаются** в основном CI-пайплайне: `pytest --ignore=tests/legacy`
		- Исключены из отчетов о покрытии кода
		- Новые тесты **ЗАПРЕЩЕНО** добавлять в эту директорию

		### Требования к покрытию тестами
		
		#### Целевые показатели покрытия
		
		```yaml
		# .coverage.yml - Требования к покрытию
		coverage_targets:
		  overall: 70%
		  critical_modules: 90%
		  
		critical_modules:
		  - apps.users.models
		  - apps.users.serializers
		  - apps.products.models
		  - apps.orders.models
		  - apps.common.services  # Включая 1С интеграцию
		  - apps.common.models    # CustomerSyncLog, ImportLog, SyncConflict
		
		integration_modules:
		  required_coverage: 85%
		  modules:

		    - apps.users.serializers  # B2B/B2C разделение
		    - apps.products.views     # Ролевое ценообразование
		```
		
		#### Обязательные тестовые сценарии
		
		**Для интеграции с 1С:**
		1. ✅ Успешный импорт покупателей из 1С
		2. ✅ Обработка конфликтов данных при импорте
		3. ✅ Экспорт новых B2B регистраций в 1С
		4. ✅ Fallback к файловому обмену при недоступности 1С
		5. ✅ Circuit breaker behavior при ошибках 1С
		6. ✅ Разрешение конфликтов различными стратегиями
		
		**Для ролевого ценообразования:**
		1. ✅ B2C пользователи видят только retail цены
		2. ✅ B2B пользователи видят свои цены + RRP/MSRP (FR5)
		3. ✅ Тренеры видят специальные цены
		4. ✅ Админы видят все цены
		5. ✅ Анонимные пользователи видят retail цены

		            # Проверяем что существует тест для этого endpoint
		            test_file_exists = self._check_test_file_exists_for_endpoint(endpoint_name)
		            assert test_file_exists, f"No test found for endpoint {endpoint_name}"
		```
		
		### Заключение по стратегии тестирования
		
		**Архитектура тестирования FREESPORT** обеспечивает:
		
		1. **Высокое покрытие критичных модулей** (90%+) включая интеграцию с 1С
		2. **Comprehensive testing** ролевого ценообразования B2B/B2C
		3. **Robust integration testing** внешних API с mock серверами
		4. **E2E validation** критически важных пользовательских потоков
		5. **Performance monitoring** интеграций в CI/CD
		
		**Особое внимание уделено**:
		- Тестированию синхронизации покупателей с 1С
		- Проверке разрешения конфликтов данных
		- Валидации ролевого ценообразования
		- Circuit breaker поведения при отказах внешних систем
		- Performance тестированию критичных интеграций

		## 10.4. Критически важная система изоляции тестов
		
		### 10.4.1. Полная изоляция тестов
		
		**🚨 КРИТИЧЕСКИ ВАЖНО**: Каждый тест должен выполняться в полностью изолированной среде. Проект использует автоматические фикстуры для обеспечения полной изоляции:
		
		```python
		# conftest.py - автоматические фикстуры изоляции
		@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
		def enable_db_access_for_all_tests(db):
		    """Автоматически включает доступ к базе данных для всех тестов"""
		    pass
		
		@pytest.fixture(autouse=True) 
		def clear_db_before_test(transactional_db):
		    """Очищает базу данных перед каждым тестом для полной изоляции"""
		    from django.core.cache import cache
		    from django.db import connection
		    from django.apps import apps
		    from django.db import transaction
		    
		    # Очищаем кэши Django
		    cache.clear()
		    
		    # Принудительная очистка всех таблиц перед тестом
		    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
		        models = apps.get_models()
		        for model in models:
		            table_name = model._meta.db_table
		            try:
		                cursor.execute(f'TRUNCATE TABLE "{table_name}" RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE')
		            except Exception:
		                pass  # Игнорируем ошибки для системных таблиц
		    
		    # Используем транзакционную изоляцию
		    with transaction.atomic():
		        yield
		```
		
		### 10.4.2. Генерация уникальных данных
		
		**Проблема**: Использование статических значений или простых последовательностей может приводить к constraint violations при параллельном выполнении тестов.
		
		**Решение**: Обязательное использование комбинированного подхода для генерации уникальных значений:
		
		```python
		import uuid
		import time
		
		# Глобальный счетчик для обеспечения уникальности
		_unique_counter = 0
		
		def get_unique_suffix():
		    """Генерирует абсолютно уникальный суффикс"""
		    global _unique_counter
		    _unique_counter += 1
		    return f"{int(time.time() * 1000)}-{_unique_counter}-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:6]}"
		
		# В Factory Boy
		class BrandFactory(factory.django.DjangoModelFactory):
		    class Meta:
		        model = Brand
		    
		    name = factory.LazyFunction(lambda: f"Brand-{get_unique_suffix()}")  # ✅ Правильно
		    # name = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"Brand-{n}")  # ❌ Может дублироваться
		```
		
		### 10.4.3. Настройки pytest для изоляции
		
		В `pytest.ini` должны быть следующие настройки:
		
		```ini
		[tool:pytest]
		DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = freesport.settings.test
		addopts = 
		    --verbose
		    --create-db        # ✅ Создавать чистую БД
		    --nomigrations     # ✅ Не выполнять миграции для скорости
		    # --reuse-db       # ❌ НЕ переиспользовать БД между запусками
		
		markers =
		    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated, no DB)
		    integration: Integration tests (with DB, API testing)
		    django_db: Tests requiring database access
		```
		
		## 10.5. Команды запуска тестов
		
		Все тесты запускаются с помощью `pytest` из корневой директории `backend/`:
		
		```bash
		# Запустить все тесты (unit + integration)
		pytest
		
		# Запустить только unit-тесты
		pytest -m unit
		
		# Запустить только интеграционные тесты
		pytest -m integration
		
		# Запустить тесты с отчетом о покрытии
		pytest --cov=apps
		
		# Запустить тесты для конкретного файла
		pytest tests/integration/test_products_api.py
		
		# Исключить устаревшие тесты (по умолчанию в CI)
		pytest --ignore=tests/legacy
		```
		
		### Docker команды для тестирования
		
		```bash
		# Тестирование в Docker (рекомендуется)
		make test                    # Все тесты с PostgreSQL + Redis
		make test-unit               # Только unit-тесты  
		make test-integration        # Только интеграционные тесты
		make test-fast               # Без пересборки образов
		```
		
		## 10.6. Обязательные правила написания тестов
		
		### 10.6.1. Правила для Factory Boy
		
		**✅ Правильно:**
		```python
		# Всегда используйте LazyFunction для уникальных полей
		class ProductFactory(factory.django.DjangoModelFactory):
		    class Meta:
		        model = Product
		    
		    name = factory.LazyFunction(lambda: f"Product-{get_unique_suffix()}")
		    sku = factory.LazyFunction(lambda: f"SKU-{get_unique_suffix().upper()}")
		    slug = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda obj: obj.name.lower().replace(' ', '-'))
		```
		
		**❌ Неправильно:**
		```python
		# НЕ используйте статические значения или простые Sequence
		class ProductFactory(factory.django.DjangoModelFactory):
		    name = "Test Product"  # ❌ Статическое значение
		    sku = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"SKU{n}")  # ❌ Может дублироваться
		```
		
		### 10.6.2. Маркировка тестов
		
		**Обязательные маркеры:**
		- `@pytest.mark.unit` - для unit тестов (без БД, быстрые)
		- `@pytest.mark.integration` - для интеграционных тестов (с БД, API)
		- `@pytest.mark.django_db` - для всех тестов, использующих БД
		
		**✅ Правильная структура файла:**
		```python
		import pytest
		from rest_framework.test import APIClient
		
		# Маркировка для всего модуля
		pytestmark = pytest.mark.django_db
		
		@pytest.mark.integration 
		class TestProductAPI:
		    def test_product_list_returns_200(self, api_client):
		        response = api_client.get('/api/products/')
		        assert response.status_code == 200
		```
		
		### 10.6.3. Структура тестов (AAA Pattern)
		
		**✅ Обязательная структура:**
		```python
		def test_order_creation_calculates_total_correctly():
		    # ARRANGE - подготовка данных
		    user = UserFactory.create()
		    product1 = ProductFactory.create(retail_price=100)
		    product2 = ProductFactory.create(retail_price=200)
		    
		    # ACT - выполнение действия
		    order = Order.objects.create(user=user)
		    OrderItem.objects.create(order=order, product=product1, quantity=1)
		    OrderItem.objects.create(order=order, product=product2, quantity=2)
		    
		    # ASSERT - проверка результата
		    assert order.calculate_total() == 500  # 100*1 + 200*2
		```
		
		### 10.6.4. Именование тестов
		
		**Файлы:**
		- Unit тесты: `tests/unit/test_[module]_[component].py`
		- Интеграционные: `tests/integration/test_[feature]_api.py`
		
		**Функции и классы:**
		- Функции: `test_[action]_[expected_result]()`
		- Классы: `Test[ComponentName]` или `Test[FeatureName]API`
		
		**✅ Примеры хороших имен:**
		```python
		def test_user_registration_creates_inactive_user():
		def test_product_search_filters_by_brand():  
		def test_order_calculation_includes_delivery_cost():
		def test_unauthorized_user_cannot_access_profile():
		
		class TestProductModel:
		class TestUserRegistrationAPI:
		class TestOrderCalculationService:
		```
		
		## 10.7. Контрольные точки качества (Quality Gates)
		
		### 10.7.1. Требования к покрытию
		
		- **Общее покрытие по проекту**: **не менее 70%**
		- **Покрытие критических модулей**: **не менее 90%**
		  - `apps.users.models`
		  - `apps.users.serializers`
		  - `apps.products.models`
		  - `apps.orders.models`
		  - `apps.common.services` (включая 1С интеграцию)
		  - `apps.common.models` (CustomerSyncLog, ImportLog, SyncConflict)
		
		### 10.7.2. CI/CD интеграция
		
		Все тесты автоматически запускаются в GitHub Actions при каждом пуше в ветки `develop` и `main`. Конфигурация находится в файле `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`. 
		
		**Критерии успеха:**
		- `unit_tests`: 100% pass
		- `integration_tests`: 100% pass  
		- `e2e_tests`: 95% pass (допустимы flaky tests)
		- `coverage`: >= 70% overall, >= 90% critical modules
		
		**Блокировка мержа**: Пулл-реквесты, в которых тесты не проходят или покрытие падает ниже установленного порога, не могут быть влиты.]]></file>

		        raw_token = self.get_raw_token(header)
		        if raw_token is None:
		            return None
		            
		        validated_token = self.get_validated_token(raw_token)

		    TRAINER = 'trainer', 'Тренер'
		    FEDERATION_REP = 'federation_rep', 'Представитель федерации'
		    ADMIN = 'admin', 'Администратор'
		
		class RoleBasedPermissionMixin:
		    """
		    Миксин для проверки разрешений на основе ролей
		    """
		    
		    def has_price_access(self, user, price_type):
		        role_permissions = {
		            'retail': ['retail_price'],
		            'wholesale_level1': ['retail_price', 'wholesale_level1_price'],

		            'admin': ['all_prices']
		        }
		        
		        allowed_prices = role_permissions.get(user.role, [])
		        return price_type in allowed_prices or 'all_prices' in allowed_prices
		```
		
		### 1.3. Безопасность интеграций с 1С

		# 12. Стратегия Обработки Ошибок
		
		## Обзор
		
		FREESPORT платформа использует комплексную стратегию обработки ошибок для обеспечения надежности системы и хорошего пользовательского опыта. Особое внимание уделяется обработке ошибок интеграции с 1С ERP и других внешних сервисов.
		
		---
		
		## 1. Архитектура обработки ошибок
		
		### 1.1. Иерархия исключений
		
		**Базовые классы исключений:**
		```python
		from django.utils.translation import gettext as _
		import logging
		
		logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
		
		class FreeSportException(Exception):
		    """
		    Базовый класс для всех пользовательских исключений FREESPORT
		    """
		    default_message = _("Произошла ошибка в системе")

		    default_status = 500
		    
		    def __init__(self, message=None, code=None, status=None, details=None):
		        self.message = message or self.default_message
		        self.code = code or self.default_code
		        self.status = status or self.default_status
		        self.details = details or {}
		        super().__init__(self.message)

		    default_code = "BUSINESS_LOGIC_ERROR"
		    default_message = _("Нарушение бизнес-правил")
		    default_status = 422
		
		class InsufficientStockException(BusinessLogicException):
		    """Недостаточно товара в наличии"""
		    default_code = "INSUFFICIENT_STOCK"

		### Deployment Strategy
		
		**Environment-Specific Orchestration:**
		- **Development/Staging**: Docker Compose (standalone)
		- **Production**: Docker Swarm Mode (orchestrated cluster)
		
		**Deployment Pipeline:**
		1. **Feature branches** → код validation и security scan
		2. **Develop branch** → полные тесты + staging deploy
		3. **Main branch** → production deployment
		
		### Container Orchestration

		# Production Deployment Guide
		
		## Обзор
		
		Данное руководство описывает развертывание FREESPORT в production, дополняя существующую Docker структуру проекта.
		
		## Существующая Инфраструктура
		
		Проект уже имеет:
		- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - development среда
		- ✅ `docker-compose.test.yml` - тестовая среда  
		- ✅ `backend/Dockerfile` и `frontend/Dockerfile`
		- ✅ `Makefile` с командами разработки
		- ✅ `docker/nginx/` - конфигурация Nginx
		
		## Production Configuration
		
		### 1. Создание docker-compose.prod.yml
		
		Дополняем существующую структуру production конфигурацией:
		
		```yaml
		# docker-compose.prod.yml
		version: '3.8'
		
		services:
		  # Наследуем Nginx из существующей структуры
		  nginx:
		    build:
		      context: ./docker/nginx
		      dockerfile: Dockerfile.prod  # Создадим отдельно
		    ports:
		      - "80:80"
		      - "443:443"
		    volumes:
		      - ./docker/nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
		      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
		      - static_volume:/var/www/static
		      - media_volume:/var/www/media
		    depends_on:
		      - backend
		      - frontend
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		
		  # Production Backend (расширяем существующий Dockerfile)
		  backend:
		    build:
		      context: ./backend
		      dockerfile: Dockerfile
		      target: production  # Multi-stage build
		      args:
		        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: freesport.settings.production
		    expose:
		      - "8001"  # Изменим порт для production
		    environment:

		      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
		      - REDIS_URL=${REDIS_URL}
		      - SECRET_KEY=${SECRET_KEY}
		      - DEBUG=False
		    volumes:
		      - static_volume:/app/static
		      - media_volume:/app/media
		      - ./logs:/app/logs
		    depends_on:
		      - db
		      - redis
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    deploy:
		      replicas: 2
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		
		  # Production Frontend
		  frontend:
		    build:
		      context: ./frontend
		      dockerfile: Dockerfile
		      target: production
		    expose:
		      - "3000"
		    environment:
		      - NODE_ENV=production
		      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}
		    depends_on:
		      - backend
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    deploy:
		      replicas: 2
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		
		  # Используем существующую конфигурацию БД
		  db:
		    image: postgres:15-alpine
		    environment:
		      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
		      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
		      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
		    volumes:
		      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
		      - ./docker/init-db.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		    # В production не открываем порт наружу
		
		  # Используем существующую конфигурацию Redis
		  redis:
		    image: redis:7-alpine
		    command: redis-server --appendonly yes --requirepass ${REDIS_PASSWORD}
		    volumes:
		      - redis_data:/data
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		
		  # Production Celery Workers
		  celery:
		    build:
		      context: ./backend
		      dockerfile: Dockerfile
		      target: production
		    command: celery -A freesport worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=4
		    environment:
		      - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=freesport.settings.production
		      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
		      - REDIS_URL=${REDIS_URL}
		    depends_on:
		      - db
		      - redis
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    deploy:
		      replicas: 2
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		
		  # Production Celery Beat
		  celery-beat:
		    build:
		      context: ./backend
		      dockerfile: Dockerfile
		      target: production
		    command: celery -A freesport beat --loglevel=info
		    environment:
		      - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=freesport.settings.production
		      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
		      - REDIS_URL=${REDIS_URL}
		    depends_on:
		      - db
		      - redis
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    networks:
		      - freesport-network
		
		volumes:
		  postgres_data:
		  redis_data:
		  static_volume:
		  media_volume:
		
		networks:
		  freesport-network:
		    driver: bridge
		```
		
		### 2. Модификация backend/Dockerfile для Production
		
		Дополняем существующий Dockerfile production стадией:
		
		```dockerfile
		# Добавляем в конец существующего backend/Dockerfile
		
		# Production стадия (добавляем к существующему multi-stage)
		FROM production as production-final
		
		# Production настройки
		ENV DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=freesport.settings.production
		ENV DEBUG=False
		ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
		
		# Создаем пользователя для безопасности
		RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser
		RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
		USER appuser
		
		# Expose port
		EXPOSE 8001
		
		# Production команда запуска
		CMD ["gunicorn", "freesport.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8001", "--workers", "4", "--worker-class", "sync", "--worker-connections", "1000", "--max-requests", "1200", "--max-requests-jitter", "50", "--access-logfile", "-", "--error-logfile", "-"]
		```
		
		### 3. Модификация frontend/Dockerfile для Production
		
		```dockerfile
		# Добавляем в конец существующего frontend/Dockerfile
		
		# Production стадия
		FROM node:18-alpine as production
		
		WORKDIR /app
		
		# Копируем package files
		COPY package*.json ./
		RUN npm ci --only=production
		
		# Копируем built app из предыдущей стадии
		COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
		COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
		COPY next.config.js ./
		
		# Создаем пользователя
		RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
		RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
		RUN chown -R nextjs:nodejs /app
		USER nextjs
		
		EXPOSE 3000
		
		CMD ["npm", "start"]
		```
		
		### 4. Production Nginx Configuration
		
		Создаем `docker/nginx/Dockerfile.prod`:
		
		```dockerfile
		FROM nginx:alpine
		
		# Копируем существующую конфигурацию
		COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
		COPY conf.d/ /etc/nginx/conf.d/
		
		# Создаем директории для логов
		RUN mkdir -p /var/log/nginx
		
		# Права на файлы
		RUN chown -R nginx:nginx /var/cache/nginx /var/run /var/log/nginx
		
		# Non-root пользователь
		USER nginx
		
		EXPOSE 80 443
		
		CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
		```
		
		Обновляем `docker/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`:
		
		```nginx
		# Production configuration для FREESPORT
		
		upstream backend {
		    server backend:8001;
		}
		
		upstream frontend {
		    server frontend:3000;
		}
		
		# HTTP to HTTPS redirect
		server {
		    listen 80;
		    server_name _;
		    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
		}
		
		# HTTPS Server
		server {
		    listen 443 ssl http2;
		    server_name _;
		    
		    # SSL Configuration (будет настроено через Let's Encrypt)
		    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem;
		    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/privkey.pem;
		    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
		    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256;
		    
		    # Security Headers
		    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
		    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
		    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
		    
		    # Static Files
		    location /static/ {
		        alias /var/www/static/;
		        expires 1y;
		        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
		    }
		    
		    location /media/ {
		        alias /var/www/media/;
		        expires 1M;
		        add_header Cache-Control "public";
		    }
		    
		    # API Routes
		    location /api/ {
		        proxy_pass http://backend;
		        proxy_set_header Host $host;
		        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		    }
		    
		    location /admin/ {
		        proxy_pass http://backend;
		        proxy_set_header Host $host;
		        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		    }
		    
		    # Frontend
		    location / {
		        proxy_pass http://frontend;
		        proxy_set_header Host $host;
		        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		    }
		}
		```
		
		### 5. Environment Configuration
		
		Создаем `.env.production`:
		
		```bash
		# Production Environment Variables
		# Database
		POSTGRES_DB=freesport
		POSTGRES_USER=freesport_user
		POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure_password_change_me
		
		# Redis
		REDIS_PASSWORD=secure_redis_password_change_me
		REDIS_URL=redis://:secure_redis_password_change_me@redis:6379/0
		
		# Django
		SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_50_chars_minimum_change_me
		DATABASE_URL=postgresql://freesport_user:secure_password_change_me@db:5432/freesport
		DEBUG=False
		ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
		
		# Frontend
		NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com
		
		# Integrations
		YUKASSA_ACCOUNT_ID=your_yukassa_account
		YUKASSA_SECRET_KEY=your_yukassa_secret
		ONEC_API_URL=https://your-1c-server.com/api
		ONEC_USERNAME=1c_user
		ONEC_PASSWORD=1c_password
		
		# Email
		EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
		EMAIL_PORT=587
		EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
		EMAIL_HOST_USER=noreply@yourdomain.com
		EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=app_password
		
		# Monitoring
		SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project
		```
		
		### 6. Расширение Makefile для Production
		
		Добавляем в существующий `Makefile`:
		
		```makefile
		# === PRODUCTION COMMANDS ===
		
		# Production сборка
		build-prod:
			@echo "Сборка production образов..."
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --no-cache
		
		# Production запуск
		up-prod:
			@echo "Запуск production среды..."
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
		
		# Production остановка
		down-prod:
			@echo "Остановка production среды..."
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
		
		# Production логи
		logs-prod:
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
		
		# Health check
		health-check:
			@echo "Проверка состояния сервисов..."
			curl -f http://localhost/api/health/ || echo "❌ API недоступно"
			curl -f http://localhost/ || echo "❌ Frontend недоступно"
		
		# Database backup
		backup-db:
			@echo "Создание backup базы данных..."
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec -T db pg_dump -U $(POSTGRES_USER) $(POSTGRES_DB) | gzip > backups/db_backup_$(shell date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql.gz
		
		# Deploy (полный цикл)
		deploy:
			@echo "🚀 Запуск production deployment..."
			make backup-db
			git pull origin main
			make build-prod
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python manage.py migrate
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
			make up-prod
			sleep 30
			make health-check
			@echo "✅ Deployment завершен"
		
		# Rollback
		rollback:
			@echo "🔄 Откат к предыдущей версии..."
			git reset --hard HEAD~1
			make build-prod
			make up-prod
			make health-check
			@echo "✅ Rollback завершен"
		```
		
		### 7. SSL Setup Script
		
		Создаем `scripts/ssl-setup.sh`:
		
		```bash
		#!/bin/bash
		# scripts/ssl-setup.sh - SSL сертификаты
		
		set -e
		
		DOMAIN=${1:-"yourdomain.com"}
		EMAIL=${2:-"admin@yourdomain.com"}
		
		echo "🔐 Настройка SSL для домена: $DOMAIN"
		
		# Установка Certbot
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install -y certbot
		
		# Создание директории для SSL
		mkdir -p ./ssl
		
		# Получение сертификата (при остановленном Nginx)
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop nginx
		
		sudo certbot certonly --standalone \
		  -d $DOMAIN \
		  -d www.$DOMAIN \
		  --email $EMAIL \
		  --agree-tos \
		  --non-interactive
		
		# Копирование сертификатов
		sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/fullchain.pem ./ssl/
		sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem ./ssl/
		sudo chmod 644 ./ssl/*.pem
		
		# Настройка автообновления
		echo "0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet --post-hook 'docker-compose -f $(pwd)/docker-compose.prod.yml restart nginx'" | sudo crontab -
		
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start nginx
		
		echo "✅ SSL сертификаты настроены"
		```
		
		### 8. Deployment Script
		
		Создаем `scripts/deploy.sh`:
		
		```bash
		#!/bin/bash
		# scripts/deploy.sh - Production Deployment
		
		set -e
		
		DEPLOY_DIR="/opt/freesport"
		BACKUP_DIR="./backups"
		DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
		
		echo "🚀 FREESPORT Production Deployment"
		
		# Создание директории для backups
		mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
		
		# Загрузка переменных окружения
		if [ -f ".env.production" ]; then
		    source .env.production
		else
		    echo "❌ Файл .env.production не найден"
		    exit 1
		fi
		
		# Backup базы данных
		echo "📦 Создание backup..."
		make backup-db
		
		# Обновление кода
		echo "📥 Обновление кода..."
		git pull origin main
		
		# Сборка новых образов
		echo "🔨 Сборка образов..."
		make build-prod
		
		# Миграции БД
		echo "🗄️ Применение миграций..."
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python manage.py migrate --noinput
		
		# Сбор статических файлов
		echo "📎 Сбор статических файлов..."
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
		
		# Rolling restart
		echo "♻️ Перезапуск сервисов..."
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps backend celery
		sleep 15
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps frontend
		sleep 10
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps nginx
		
		# Health check
		echo "🏥 Проверка состояния..."
		sleep 30
		make health-check
		
		# Очистка старых образов
		echo "🧹 Очистка..."
		docker image prune -f
		
		echo "🎉 Deployment завершен успешно!"
		```
		
		## Production Checklist
		
		### Перед развертыванием:
		- [ ] Сервер настроен и доступен
		- [ ] Домен настроен и указывает на сервер
		- [ ] SSL сертификаты получены
		- [ ] `.env.production` настроен с реальными значениями
		- [ ] Firewall настроен (порты 80, 443, SSH)
		- [ ] Backup стратегия настроена
		
		### После развертывания:
		- [ ] Все сервисы запущены (`docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps`)
		- [ ] Health check проходит (`make health-check`)
		- [ ] SSL работает (проверить в браузере)
		- [ ] Статические файлы загружаются
		- [ ] API отвечает корректно
		- [ ] Мониторинг настроен
		
		## Мониторинг
		
		Добавляем health check endpoint в Django:
		
		```python
		# backend/apps/common/views.py
		from django.http import JsonResponse
		from django.db import connection
		
		def health_check(request):
		    """Production health check"""
		    try:
		        # Database check
		        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
		            cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
		        
		        # Redis check (если используется)
		        from django.core.cache import cache
		        cache.set('health_check', 'ok', 10)
		        
		        return JsonResponse({
		            'status': 'healthy',
		            'database': 'ok',
		            'cache': 'ok'
		        })
		    except Exception as e:
		        return JsonResponse({
		            'status': 'unhealthy',
		            'error': str(e)
		        }, status=503)
		```
		
		## Команды для работы с Production
		
		Расширенные команды через существующий Makefile:
		
		```bash
		# Запуск production среды
		make up-prod
		
		# Просмотр логов
		make logs-prod
		
		# Проверка состояния
		make health-check
		
		# Полный deployment
		make deploy
		
		# Backup базы данных
		make backup-db
		
		# Откат изменений
		make rollback
		```

		## Существующие Паттерны (используйте их!)
		
		### 1. Django Models (apps/products/models.py)
		
		**Реальный пример из кодабазы:**
		```python
		class Brand(models.Model):
		    """Модель бренда товаров"""
		    
		    name = models.CharField("Название бренда", max_length=100, unique=True)
		    slug = models.SlugField("Slug", max_length=255, unique=True)
		    logo = models.ImageField("Логотип", upload_to="brands/", blank=True)
		    description = models.TextField("Описание", blank=True)
		    website = models.URLField("Веб-сайт", blank=True)
		    is_active = models.BooleanField("Активный", default=True)
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField("Дата создания", auto_now_add=True)
		    updated_at = models.DateTimeField("Дата обновления", auto_now=True)
		
		    class Meta:
		        verbose_name = "Бренд"
		        verbose_name_plural = "Бренды"
		        db_table = "brands"  # 👈 Используют кастомные имена таблиц
		
		    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
		        if not self.slug:
		            self.slug = slugify(self.name)  # 👈 Авто-генерация slug
		        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
		```
		
		**Паттерн для новых моделей:**
		```python
		class YourModel(models.Model):
		    """Описание вашей модели"""
		    
		    # Обязательные поля (следуйте паттерну проекта)
		    name = models.CharField("Название", max_length=255)
		    is_active = models.BooleanField("Активный", default=True)
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField("Дата создания", auto_now_add=True)
		    updated_at = models.DateTimeField("Дата обновления", auto_now=True)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        verbose_name = "Ваша модель"
		        verbose_name_plural = "Ваши модели"
		        db_table = "your_table_name"  # 👈 Кастомное имя таблицы
		        ordering = ['-created_at']    # 👈 Сортировка по умолчанию
		```
		
		### 2. Django Serializers (apps/products/serializers.py)
		
		**Реальный паттерн из кодабазы:**
		```python
		class ProductImageSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
		    """Serializer для изображений товара"""
		    url = serializers.SerializerMethodField()  # 👈 Кастомные поля
		    
		    class Meta:
		        model = ProductImage
		        fields = ['url', 'alt_text', 'is_main', 'sort_order']
		    
		    def get_url(self, obj):
		        """Получить URL изображения с учетом контекста запроса"""
		        if isinstance(obj, dict):  # 👈 Обработка dict и model объектов
		            return obj.get('url', '')
		        
		        if hasattr(obj, 'url'):
		            url = obj.url
		        elif hasattr(obj, 'image') and hasattr(obj.image, 'url'):
		            url = obj.image.url
		        else:
		            return ''
		```
		
		### 3. Django ViewSets (apps/products/views.py)
		
		**Реальный паттерн из кодабазы:**
		```python
		from rest_framework import viewsets, permissions, filters
		from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination
		from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
		from drf_spectacular.utils import extend_schema, OpenApiParameter  # 👈 OpenAPI docs
		
		class CustomPageNumberPagination(PageNumberPagination):  # 👈 Кастомная пагинация
		    page_size_query_param = 'page_size'
		
		class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):  # 👈 ReadOnly для каталога
		    """ViewSet для товаров с фильтрацией и ролевым ценообразованием"""
		    
		    permission_classes = [permissions.AllowAny]
		    pagination_class = CustomPageNumberPagination
		    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend, filters.SearchFilter]
		    filterset_class = ProductFilter  # 👈 Кастомные фильтры
		    search_fields = ['name', 'description']
		    
		    @extend_schema(  # 👈 OpenAPI документация
		        description="Получить список товаров с фильтрацией",
		        parameters=[
		            OpenApiParameter(name='category', description='ID категории', type=int),
		        ]
		    )
		    def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		        return super().list(request, *args, **kwargs)
		```
		
		### 4. User Model (apps/users/models.py)
		
		**Специфика проекта - кастомная User модель:**
		```python
		class UserManager(BaseUserManager):
		    """Кастомный менеджер с email аутентификацией"""
		    
		    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
		        if not email:
		            raise ValueError("Email обязателен для создания пользователя")
		        # ... реализация
		
		class User(AbstractUser):
		    """Кастомная модель пользователя с ролевой системой"""
		    
		    # 👈 В проекте используется email вместо username
		    username = None  # Отключаем username
		    email = models.EmailField("Email", unique=True)
		    
		    # 👈 Ролевая система B2B/B2C
		    ROLE_CHOICES = [
		        ('retail', 'Розничный покупатель'),
		        ('wholesale_level1', 'Оптовик уровень 1'),
		        ('wholesale_level2', 'Оптовик уровень 2'),
		        ('wholesale_level3', 'Оптовик уровень 3'),
		        ('trainer', 'Тренер'),
		        ('federation_rep', 'Представитель федерации'),
		        ('admin', 'Администратор'),
		    ]
		    role = models.CharField("Роль", max_length=20, choices=ROLE_CHOICES, default='retail')
		    
		    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'  # 👈 Аутентификация по email
		    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
		```
		
		### 5. Frontend Components (components/ui/Button.tsx)
		
		**Реальный паттерн UI компонента:**
		```typescript
		import React from 'react';
		import type { BaseComponentProps } from '@/types';  // 👈 Общие типы
		
		interface ButtonProps extends BaseComponentProps {
		  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'danger';
		  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
		  disabled?: boolean;
		  loading?: boolean;  // 👈 Поддержка loading состояния
		  type?: 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset';
		  onClick?: (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;
		}
		
		const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
		  children,
		  className = '',
		  variant = 'primary',
		  size = 'md',
		  disabled = false,
		  loading = false,
		  type = 'button',
		  onClick,
		  ...props  // 👈 Spread остальных props
		}) => {
		  // 👈 Используют Tailwind CSS классы
		  const baseStyles = 'inline-flex items-center justify-center font-medium rounded-lg transition-all duration-200 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed';
		  
		  const variantStyles = {
		    primary: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-blue-500',
		    secondary: 'bg-gray-600 text-white hover:bg-gray-700 focus:ring-gray-500',
		    // ... остальные варианты
		  };
		  
		  // 👈 Динамическая сборка классов
		  const buttonClasses = [
		    baseStyles,
		    variantStyles[variant],
		    sizeStyles[size],
		    loading && 'cursor-wait',
		    className,
		  ].filter(Boolean).join(' ');
		  
		  return (
		    <button
		      type={type}
		      className={buttonClasses}
		      disabled={disabled || loading}
		      onClick={onClick}
		      {...props}
		    >
		      {loading && (
		        // 👈 SVG spinner для loading состояния
		        <svg className="-ml-1 mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" ...>
		          {/* SVG content */}
		        </svg>
		      )}
		      {children}
		    </button>
		  );
		};
		```
		
		## Специфика Проекта FREESPORT
		
		### 1. Ролевое Ценообразование
		
		**Использование в products/models.py:**
		```python
		class Product(models.Model):
		    # 👈 Разные цены для разных ролей пользователей
		    retail_price = models.DecimalField("Розничная цена", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
		    opt1_price = models.DecimalField("Оптовая цена 1", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True)
		    opt2_price = models.DecimalField("Оптовая цена 2", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True)
		    opt3_price = models.DecimalField("Оптовая цена 3", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True)
		    trainer_price = models.DecimalField("Цена для тренеров", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True)
		    federation_price = models.DecimalField("Цена для федераций", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True)
		    
		    def get_price_for_user(self, user):
		        """Получить цену товара для конкретного пользователя"""
		        price_map = {
		            'retail': self.retail_price,
		            'wholesale_level1': self.opt1_price or self.retail_price,
		            'wholesale_level2': self.opt2_price or self.retail_price,
		            'wholesale_level3': self.opt3_price or self.retail_price,
		            'trainer': self.trainer_price or self.retail_price,
		            'federation_rep': self.federation_price or self.retail_price,
		        }
		        return price_map.get(user.role, self.retail_price)
		```
		
		### 2. Дедупликация в Корзине (apps/cart/)
		
		**Существующий паттерн:**
		```python
		# Корзина использует unique_together для предотвращения дубликатов
		class CartItem(models.Model):
		    cart = models.ForeignKey(Cart, related_name='items', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=1)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        unique_together = ('cart', 'product')  # 👈 Один товар = одна позиция
		```
		
		### 3. Тестирование (следуйте существующим паттернам)
		
		**Структура тестов (уже существует):**
		```python
		# tests/unit/ - Unit тесты
		# tests/integration/ - Интеграционные тесты
		# frontend/src/components/__tests__/ - Frontend тесты
		```
		
		## Шаблоны для AI Агентов
		
		### Создание нового Django App
		
		```bash
		# 1. Создать приложение
		cd backend/apps
		python ../manage.py startapp your_app_name
		
		# 2. Добавить в INSTALLED_APPS
		'apps.your_app_name',
		
		# 3. Создать базовые файлы по паттерну существующих apps
		```
		
		### Создание нового React Компонента
		
		```typescript
		// src/components/YourComponent/YourComponent.tsx
		import React from 'react';
		import type { BaseComponentProps } from '@/types';
		
		interface YourComponentProps extends BaseComponentProps {
		  // ваши props
		}
		
		const YourComponent: React.FC<YourComponentProps> = ({
		  className = '',
		  children,
		  ...props
		}) => {
		  return (
		    <div className={`your-base-classes ${className}`} {...props}>
		      {children}
		    </div>
		  );
		};
		
		export default YourComponent;
		
		// src/components/YourComponent/index.ts
		export { default } from './YourComponent';
		export type { YourComponentProps } from './YourComponent';
		```
		
		## Важные Принципы
		
		### 1. Следуйте существующим соглашениям:
		- ✅ Русские verbose_name в моделях Django
		- ✅ db_table для кастомных имен таблиц  
		- ✅ Tailwind CSS для стилизации
		- ✅ TypeScript типы для всех компонентов

		# 17. Performance SLA и Метрики
		
		## Обзор
		
		Этот документ определяет Service Level Agreements (SLA) для производительности платформы FREESPORT, основанный на существующих performance тестах и мониторинге.
		
		## Существующая Инфраструктура Производительности
		
		### Performance тесты (backend/tests/performance/)
		
		Проект уже содержит комплексные тесты производительности:
		
		- **test_catalog_performance.py**: каталог товаров, фильтрация, пагинация
		- **test_search_performance.py**: поиск и индексирование  
		- **test_order_creation_performance.py**: создание заказов
		
		### Индексы БД (apps/users/migrations/0003_add_performance_indexes.py)
		
		Оптимизированные индексы для критических запросов:
		- B2B пользователи: `users_b2b_users_idx`
		- Email + статус: `users_email_active_idx`  
		- Адреса по умолчанию: `addresses_default_idx`
		- ИНН компаний: `companies_tax_id_idx`
		
		### Кэширование (Redis)
		
		Настроенное в `settings/base.py` и `docker-compose.yml`:
		- Redis 7.0+ с persistence
		- Django-redis backend
		- Session и cache storage
		
		## SLA Метрики
		
		### Базовые SLA (из docs/architecture/13-monitoring.md)
		
		| Метрика | SLA | Источник |
		|---------|-----|----------|
		| API response time | < 2 сек | Мониторинг |
		| Database query time | < 1 сек | Мониторинг |
		| Error rate | < 5% | Мониторинг |
		| System uptime | 99.9% | Мониторинг |
		| CPU usage | < 75% | Мониторинг |
		| Memory usage | < 80% | Мониторинг |
		| Disk usage | < 85% | Мониторинг |
		
		### Детализированные Performance SLA (из тестов)
		
		#### Каталог товаров
		```python
		# Основанные на test_catalog_performance.py
		```
		
		| Endpoint | SLA | Тест |
		|----------|-----|------|
		| `GET /api/v1/products/` | < 1.0 сек | `test_catalog_list_performance` |
		| `GET /api/v1/products/?filters` | < 1.5 сек | `test_catalog_with_filters_performance` |
		| `GET /api/v1/products/{id}/` | < 0.5 сек | `test_product_detail_performance` |
		| `GET /api/v1/categories-tree/` | < 0.3 сек | `test_categories_tree_performance` |
		| `GET /api/v1/brands/` | < 0.2 сек | `test_brands_list_performance` |
		
		#### Пагинация и производительность
		| Метрика | SLA | Описание |
		|---------|-----|----------|
		| Страница каталога (20 товаров) | < 1.0 сек | Стандартная пагинация |
		| Ролевое ценообразование | < 1.2 сек | Каталог с ролевыми ценами |
		| DB queries за запрос | < 10 запросов | Контроль N+1 проблемы |
		| Использование памяти | < 50MB | Per request memory usage |
		
		#### Стресс-тесты
		| Метрика | SLA | Условие |
		|---------|-----|---------|
		| Среднее время ответа | < 1.0 сек | 10 последовательных запросов |
		| Максимальное время ответа | < 2.0 сек | Пиковая нагрузка |
		| Деградация производительности | < 20% | При увеличении нагрузки |
		
		## Мониторинг и Алертинг
		
		### Логирование (settings/production.py)
		
		Структурированное логирование для анализа производительности:
		
		```python
		LOGGING = {
		    "handlers": {
		        "file": {
		            "class": "logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler",
		            "filename": BASE_DIR / "logs" / "django.log",
		            "maxBytes": 15MB,  # 15MB лог-файлы
		            "backupCount": 10,
		        }
		    }
		}
		```
		
		### Health Check Endpoints
		
		Health checks для мониторинга доступности (docker-compose.yml):
		
		```yaml
		healthcheck:
		  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U freesport_user -d freesport"]
		  interval: 30s
		  timeout: 10s  
		  retries: 5
		```
		
		### Метрики для Dashboard
		
		#### Основные KPI
		- **Response Time P50/P95/P99**: медианное, 95-й и 99-й перцентили
		- **Throughput**: запросов в секунду (RPS)
		- **Error Rate**: процент ошибочных ответов
		- **Apdex Score**: Application Performance Index
		
		#### Бизнес-метрики
		- **Conversion Rate**: корзина → заказ
		- **Page Load Time**: время загрузки каталога
		- **Search Performance**: время поиска товаров
		- **B2B Response Time**: ролевое ценообразование
		
		#### Инфраструктурные метрики
		- **Database Query Time**: среднее время запросов к БД
		- **Cache Hit Ratio**: эффективность Redis кэша  
		- **Memory Usage**: per-process память
		- **Active Connections**: подключения к БД
		
		## Инструменты Мониторинга

		   - Network latency
		
		## Escalation и Response
		
		### Критичность инцидентов
		
		#### P1 - Critical (< 15 минут response)
		- API downtime > 1 минута
		- Error rate > 25%
		- Response time > 5 секунд
		
		#### P2 - High (< 1 час response)  
		- Error rate 10-25%
		- Response time 2-5 секунд
		- Database connection issues
		
		#### P3 - Medium (< 4 часа response)
		- Error rate 5-10% 
		- Response time превышает SLA на 20%
		- Cache miss rate > 30%
		
		#### P4 - Low (< 1 день response)
		- Performance degradation < 20%
		- Non-critical feature issues
		- Optimization opportunities
		
		### Автоматические действия
		
		1. **Auto-scaling** при превышении CPU/Memory лимитов

		    ("retail", "Розничный покупатель"),
		    ("wholesale_level1", "Оптовик уровень 1"),
		    ("wholesale_level2", "Оптовик уровень 2"), 
		    ("wholesale_level3", "Оптовик уровень 3"),
		    ("trainer", "Тренер/Фитнес-клуб"),
		    ("federation_rep", "Представитель федерации"),
		    ("admin", "Администратор"),
		]
		```
		
		### Поля верификации в User модели
		
		```python
		# B2B поля
		company_name = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True)
		tax_id = models.CharField(max_length=12, blank=True)
		
		# Статус верификации для B2B
		is_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)
		```
		
		### Company модель для расширенных B2B данных
		
		```python
		class Company(models.Model):
		    user = models.OneToOneField(User, related_name="company")
		    legal_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
		    tax_id = models.CharField(max_length=12, unique=True)
		    kpp = models.CharField(max_length=9, blank=True)
		    legal_address = models.TextField()
		    # Банковские реквизиты
		    bank_name = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True)
		    bank_bik = models.CharField(max_length=9, blank=True) 
		    account_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True)
		```
		
		## Процесс Регистрации B2B
		
		### 1. Регистрация через UserRegistrationSerializer
		
		**Автоматическая валидация (apps/users/serializers.py:59-78):**
		
		```python
		def validate(self, attrs):
		    role = attrs.get("role", "retail")
		    if role != "retail":
		        # Для B2B пользователей требуется название компании
		        if not attrs.get("company_name"):
		            raise serializers.ValidationError({
		                "company_name": "Название компании обязательно для B2B пользователей."
		            })
		        
		        # Для оптовиков и представителей федерации требуется ИНН
		        if role.startswith("wholesale") or role == "federation_rep":
		            if not attrs.get("tax_id"):
		                raise serializers.ValidationError({
		                    "tax_id": "ИНН обязателен для оптовых покупателей и представителей федерации."
		                })
		```
		
		**Автоматическая установка статуса (apps/users/serializers.py:92-95):**
		
		```python
		# B2B пользователи требуют верификации
		if user.role != "retail":
		    user.is_verified = False
		    user.save()
		```
		
		### 2. Статусы верификации
		
		#### Определение статуса (apps/users/views/personal_cabinet.py:60)
		
		```python
		verification_status = "verified" if user.is_verified else "pending"
		```
		
		#### Отображение в дашборде
		
		B2B пользователи видят `verification_status` в персональном дашборде:
		
		```python
		# personal_cabinet.py:57-60
		if user.is_b2b_user:
		    verification_status = "verified" if user.is_verified else "pending"
		```
		
		## Детализированный Workflow
		
		### Этап 1: Регистрация B2B пользователя
		
		1. **Frontend форма регистрации** отправляет данные:
		   ```json
		   {
		     "email": "company@example.com",
		     "password": "password123",
		     "password_confirm": "password123",
		     "first_name": "Иван",
		     "last_name": "Иванов",
		     "phone": "+79001234567",
		     "role": "wholesale_level1",
		     "company_name": "ООО Спорт Компани",
		     "tax_id": "1234567890"
		   }
		   ```
		
		2. **UserRegistrationSerializer валидация:**
		   - Проверка уникальности email
		   - Валидация обязательных B2B полей
		   - Создание пользователя с `is_verified = False`
		
		3. **Автоматические действия системы:**
		   - Создание User записи
		   - Установка `is_verified = False` для B2B ролей
		   - Отправка welcome email (TODO: реализовать)
		
		### Этап 2: Автоматические проверки
		
		#### Проверка дубликатов ИНН
		
		```sql
		-- Существующий индекс (apps/users/migrations/0003_add_performance_indexes.py:64-67)
		CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS companies_tax_id_idx ON companies (tax_id);
		```
		
		**Реализация проверки:**
		```python
		# В UserRegistrationSerializer.validate()
		if attrs.get("tax_id"):
		    if User.objects.filter(tax_id=attrs["tax_id"]).exists():
		        raise serializers.ValidationError({
		            "tax_id": "Компания с данным ИНН уже зарегистрирована."
		        })
		```
		
		#### Валидация формата ИНН
		
		```python
		import re
		
		def validate_tax_id(self, value):
		    """Валидация российского ИНН"""
		    if not value:
		        return value
		        
		    # Удаляем пробелы и дефисы
		    inn = re.sub(r'[^\d]', '', value)
		    
		    # ИНН может быть 10 или 12 цифр
		    if len(inn) not in [10, 12]:
		        raise serializers.ValidationError(
		            "ИНН должен содержать 10 или 12 цифр."
		        )
		    
		    # TODO: Добавить контрольную сумму ИНН
		    return inn
		```
		
		### Этап 3: Ручная верификация администратором
		
		#### Django Admin Interface (ОТСУТСТВУЕТ - нужно создать)
		
		**Требуемый функционал:**
		
		```python
		# apps/users/admin.py (СОЗДАТЬ)
		from django.contrib import admin
		from django.utils.html import format_html
		from .models import User, Company
		
		@admin.register(User)
		class UserAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
		    list_display = ['email', 'full_name', 'role', 'company_name', 
		                   'verification_status_display', 'created_at']
		    list_filter = ['role', 'is_verified', 'is_active', 'created_at']
		    search_fields = ['email', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'company_name', 'tax_id']
		    
		    # B2B пользователи, ожидающие верификации
		    def get_queryset(self, request):
		        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
		        # Добавить quick filter для pending verification
		        return qs
		    
		    def verification_status_display(self, obj):
		        if obj.role == 'retail':
		            return '-'
		        
		        if obj.is_verified:
		            return format_html(
		                '<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">✓ Верифицирован</span>'
		            )
		        else:
		            return format_html(
		                '<span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">⏳ Ожидает верификации</span>'
		            )
		    
		    verification_status_display.short_description = 'Статус верификации'
		    
		    # Bulk actions для верификации
		    actions = ['verify_users', 'reject_verification']
		    
		    def verify_users(self, request, queryset):
		        """Верифицировать выбранных пользователей"""
		        count = queryset.filter(role__in=[
		            'wholesale_level1', 'wholesale_level2', 'wholesale_level3',
		            'trainer', 'federation_rep'
		        ]).update(is_verified=True)
		        
		        self.message_user(request, f'Верифицировано {count} пользователей.')
		    
		    verify_users.short_description = 'Верифицировать выбранных пользователей'
		```
		
		#### Процесс ручной верификации
		
		1. **Администратор заходит в Django Admin**
		2. **Фильтрует пользователей:** 
		   - Role ≠ 'retail'
		   - is_verified = False
		3. **Проверяет документы** (вне системы)
		4. **Принимает решение:**
		   - ✅ Верифицировать: `is_verified = True`
		   - ❌ Отклонить: статус остается False + комментарий
		
		#### Уведомления о результатах (TODO)
		
		```python
		# После изменения is_verified
		from django.db.models.signals import post_save
		from django.dispatch import receiver
		
		@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
		def handle_verification_status_change(sender, instance, **kwargs):
		    """Отправка уведомлений при изменении статуса верификации"""
		    if instance.is_b2b_user and instance.is_verified:
		        # Отправить email об успешной верификации
		        send_verification_success_email.delay(instance.id)
		```
		
		### Этап 4: Влияние верификации на функциональность
		
		#### Ограничения для неверифицированных B2B
		
		**В каталоге товаров (products/serializers.py):**
		
		```python
		def get_current_price(self, obj):
		    """Получить цену с учетом верификации"""
		    user = self.context['request'].user
		    
		    if user.is_authenticated and user.is_b2b_user:
		        if not user.is_verified:
		            # Неверифицированные B2B видят только розничную цену
		            return obj.retail_price
		        # Верифицированные получают B2B цены
		        return obj.get_price_for_user(user)
		    
		    return obj.retail_price
		```
		
		**В корзине (cart/serializers.py):**
		
		```python
		def validate_quantity(self, value):
		    """Валидация количества с учетом верификации"""
		    user = self.context['request'].user
		    product = self.initial_data.get('product')
		    
		    if user.is_b2b_user and not user.is_verified:
		        # Неверифицированные B2B не могут заказывать оптом
		        if value > 10:  # Лимит для неверифицированных
		            raise serializers.ValidationError(
		                "Для заказа больших объемов требуется верификация компании."
		            )
		```
		
		**В заказах (orders/serializers.py):**
		
		```python
		def validate_payment_method(self, value):
		    """Валидация способа оплаты"""
		    user = self.context['request'].user
		    
		    if user.is_b2b_user and not user.is_verified:
		        # Неверифицированные B2B не могут использовать безналичный расчет
		        if value == 'bank_transfer':
		            raise serializers.ValidationError(
		                "Безналичный расчет доступен только верифицированным компаниям."
		            )
		```
		
		### Этап 5: Интеграция с существующими тестами
		
		#### Дополнения к B2B workflow тестам
		
		**Расширение test_b2b_workflow.py:**
		
		```python
		def test_unverified_b2b_limitations(self):
		    """Ограничения для неверифицированных B2B пользователей"""
		    unverified_user = User.objects.create_user(
		        email="unverified@example.com",
		        role="wholesale_level1",
		        company_name="Unverified Company",
		        is_verified=False
		    )
		    
		    self.client.force_authenticate(user=unverified_user)
		    
		    # 1. Видят только розничные цены
		    response = self.client.get(f"/api/v1/products/{self.product.id}/")
		    self.assertEqual(float(response.data["current_price"]), 1000.00)  # retail_price
		    
		    # 2. Ограничения по количеству
		    cart_data = {"product": self.product.id, "quantity": 15}
		    response = self.client.post("/api/v1/cart/items/", cart_data)
		    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)
		    
		    # 3. Ограничения по способу оплаты
		    self.client.post("/api/v1/cart/items/", {"product": self.product.id, "quantity": 5})
		    order_data = {
		        "delivery_address": "Address",
		        "payment_method": "bank_transfer"
		    }
		    response = self.client.post("/api/v1/orders/", order_data)
		    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)
		
		def test_verification_workflow_complete(self):
		    """Полный цикл верификации"""
		    # 1. Регистрация B2B пользователя
		    registration_data = {
		        "email": "newcompany@example.com",
		        "password": "password123",
		        "password_confirm": "password123",
		        "role": "wholesale_level1",
		        "company_name": "New Company",
		        "tax_id": "9876543210"
		    }
		    response = self.client.post("/api/v1/auth/register/", registration_data)
		    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)
		    
		    user = User.objects.get(email="newcompany@example.com")
		    self.assertFalse(user.is_verified)  # Автоматически неверифицирован
		    
		    # 2. Верификация администратором
		    user.is_verified = True
		    user.save()
		    
		    # 3. Проверка доступности B2B функций
		    self.client.force_authenticate(user=user)
		    response = self.client.get(f"/api/v1/products/{self.product.id}/")
		    self.assertEqual(float(response.data["current_price"]), 800.00)  # B2B цена
		```
		
		## Метрики и Мониторинг
		
		### KPI верификации
		
		1. **Conversion Rate**: регистрация → верификация
		2. **Verification Time**: среднее время обработки заявки
		3. **Rejection Rate**: процент отклоненных заявок
		4. **User Satisfaction**: обратная связь после верификации
		
		### Dashboard для администраторов
		
		```sql
		-- Статистика верификации
		SELECT 
		    role,
		    COUNT(*) as total_users,
		    COUNT(CASE WHEN is_verified = true THEN 1 END) as verified_users,
		    COUNT(CASE WHEN is_verified = false THEN 1 END) as pending_users,
		    ROUND(
		        COUNT(CASE WHEN is_verified = true THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
		    ) as verification_rate
		FROM users 
		WHERE role != 'retail'
		GROUP BY role
		ORDER BY total_users DESC;
		```
		
		## Улучшения и Roadmap
		
		### Краткосрочные улучшения (1-2 недели)
		
		1. **Создать Django Admin интерфейс** для управления верификацией
		2. **Добавить валидацию ИНН** с контрольной суммой  
		3. **Реализовать email уведомления** о результатах верификации
		4. **Расширить тестовое покрытие** для всех сценариев
		
		### Среднесрочные улучшения (1-2 месяца)
		
		1. **Автоматизация проверок:**
		   - Интеграция с API ФНС для проверки ИНН
		   - Проверка статуса компании (активная/ликвидирована)
		   - Blacklist проверка
		
		2. **Workflow для документов:**
		   - Загрузка документов (ОГРН, выписка из ЕГРЮЛ)
		   - Электронная подпись документов
		   - Автоматическое распознавание реквизитов
		
		3. **Уведомления и коммуникации:**
		   - SMS уведомления о статусе

		   - Чат с поддержкой для вопросов по верификации
		
		### Долгосрочные улучшения (3-6 месяцев)
		
		1. **Полная автоматизация:**
		   - ML модель для оценки рисков
		   - Интеграция с внешними KYC сервисами  
		   - Автоматическая верификация для низкорисковых компаний
		
		2. **Advanced функциональность:**
		   - Уровни доверия (не только verified/unverified)
		   - Кредитные лимиты на основе верификации
		   - Персональные менеджеры для крупных клиентов
		
		## Заключение
		
		B2B verification workflow в FREESPORT основан на надежной существующей архитектуре:
		
		- ✅ **Ролевая модель** с четким разделением B2B/B2C
		- ✅ **Автоматическая валидация** обязательных полей при регистрации  
		- ✅ **Статус верификации** с влиянием на функциональность
		- ✅ **Тестовое покрытие** для основных сценариев
		- ✅ **Performance индексы** для быстрых запросов
		
		**Следующий шаг:** создание Django Admin интерфейса для управления процессом верификации администраторами.]]></file>

		```yaml
		services:
		  db:
		    image: postgres:15-alpine
		    environment:
		      POSTGRES_DB: freesport_test
		      POSTGRES_USER: freesport_user
		      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password123
		    ports:
		      - "5433:5432"  # Не конфликтует с основной БД
		```
		
		### Production Setup
		
		**Для staging/production используется PostgreSQL:**
		```bash
		# Переменные в .env
		DB_NAME=freesport
		DB_USER=freesport_user
		DB_PASSWORD=secure-password
		DB_HOST=db-host
		DB_PORT=5432
		DB_SSLMODE=require
		```

		- ✅ Zustand DevTools для state management
		- ✅ TanStack Query DevTools (если используется)
		
		## Performance Monitoring
		
		### Development Profiling
		
		#### Backend Performance
		
		**Уже встроенные инструменты:**
		```python
		# Performance тесты в tests/performance/
		pytest tests/performance/ -v
		
		# Profiling отдельного теста
		pytest tests/performance/test_catalog_performance.py::test_memory_usage_catalog -v
		```
		
		#### Database Queries
		
		```python  
		# Включить логирование SQL в development
		LOGGING['loggers']['django.db.backends'] = {
		    'handlers': ['console'],
		    'level': 'DEBUG',
		}
		```
		
		### Frontend Performance
		
		```bash
		# Bundle analysis
		npm run build
		npm run start
		
		# Lighthouse audit
		# Использовать Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse
		```
		
		## Git Workflow
		
		### Branch Strategy
		
		```bash
		# Основанные на существующих ветках
		main       # продакшен ветка (защищена)
		develop    # основная ветка разработки (защищена)
		feature/*  # ветки для новых функций
		hotfix/*   # критические исправления
		```
		
		### Pre-commit Setup (рекомендуется)
		
		```bash
		# Установить pre-commit
		pip install pre-commit
		
		# Создать .pre-commit-config.yaml
		cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << EOF
		repos:
		  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
		    rev: 23.11.0
		    hooks:
		      - id: black
		        language_version: python3.12
		  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
		    rev: 5.12.0
		    hooks:
		      - id: isort
		  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
		    rev: 6.1.0
		    hooks:
		      - id: flake8
		EOF
		
		# Установить хуки
		pre-commit install
		```
		
		## Troubleshooting
		
		### Часто встречающиеся проблемы
		
		#### 1. Docker порты заняты
		
		```bash
		# Проверить занятые порты
		netstat -tulpn | grep :8001
		netstat -tulpn | grep :3000
		
		# Остановить конфликтующие сервисы
		make down
		docker-compose ps
		```
		
		#### 2. Database migration проблемы
		
		```bash
		# Сбросить миграции (SQLite)
		rm backend/db.sqlite3
		python backend/manage.py migrate
		
		# PostgreSQL в Docker
		docker-compose down -v  # удалить volumes
		docker-compose up -d
		```
		
		#### 3. Node.js dependency conflicts
		
		```bash
		cd frontend
		rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
		npm cache clean --force
		npm install
		```
		
		#### 4. Python virtual environment
		
		```bash
		# Пересоздать venv
		rm -rf backend/venv
		cd backend
		python -m venv venv
		source venv/bin/activate  # или venv\Scripts\activate на Windows
		pip install -r requirements.txt
		```
		
		### Кодировка Windows (UTF-8)
		
		**Уже настроено в settings/base.py:**
		```python
		# Настройка кодировки для Windows консоли
		if sys.platform == "win32":
		    try:
		        locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "ru_RU.UTF-8")
		    except locale.Error:
		        try:
		            locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, "Russian_Russia.1251")
		        except locale.Error:
		            pass
		```
		
		### Performance Issues
		
		#### Backend медленно отвечает
		
		1. **Проверить Database queries:**
		   ```python
		   from django.db import connection
		   print(len(connection.queries))  # количество запросов
		   ```
		
		2. **Использовать Django Debug Toolbar**
		3. **Запустить performance тесты:**
		   ```bash
		   pytest tests/performance/ -v
		   ```
		
		#### Frontend медленно загружается
		
		1. **Использовать Next.js турбо режим** (уже настроен)
		2. **Проверить bundle size** с bundle analyzer
		3. **Проверить network requests** в DevTools
		
		## Production Deployment
		
		### Различия от Development
		
		1. **Database:** PostgreSQL вместо SQLite
		2. **Cache:** Redis с персистентностью  
		3. **Static files:** S3/CDN вместо локальных файлов
		4. **Environment:** `DJANGO_ENVIRONMENT=production`
		5. **Debug:** `DEBUG=False`
		6. **HTTPS:** Обязательный SSL
		
		**Подробности в:** `docs/architecture/15-deployment-guide.md`
		
		## Заключение
		
		Development environment FREESPORT полностью автоматизирован и оптимизирован:
		
		- ✅ **Docker first** подход с полной изоляцией
		- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** с 70%+ coverage требованием
		- ✅ **Automated scripts** для всех платформ (Windows/Linux/macOS)  
		- ✅ **Performance monitoring** встроенный в development flow
		- ✅ **IDE integration** готовая конфигурация для VSCode/PyCharm
		- ✅ **Troubleshooting guide** для быстрого решения проблем
		
		**Следующие шаги для новых разработчиков:**
		1. Клонировать репозиторий 
		2. Выполнить `make up`
		3. Открыть http://localhost:3000
		4. Начать разработку!]]></file>

		## 1. Обзор интеграции
		
		### 1.1 Бизнес-требования
		
		**FREESPORT Platform** интегрируется с **1С:Управление торговлей** для обеспечения:
		
		- **Синхронизации товаров:** Загрузка каталога, цен, характеристик
		- **Управления остатками:** Актуальная информация о наличии товаров  
		- **Синхронизации покупателей:** Двусторонняя синхронизация клиентской базы
		- **Обработки заказов:** Экспорт заказов из веб-платформы в 1С
		- **Синхронизации статусов:** Обновление статусов заказов из 1С
		
		### 1.2 Архитектурная схема интеграции
		
		```mermaid
		graph TB
		    subgraph "1С:Управление торговлей"
		        A[Товары и номенклатура] --> B[Экспорт CommerceML]

		        E[Справочник клиентов] --> F[Выгрузка клиентов]
		        G[Статусы заказов] --> H[HTTP API 1С]
		    end

		        H --> J[Webhook Handlers]
		        I --> K[Data Parsers]
		        K --> L[Data Validators]
		        L --> M[Django Models]
		        M --> N[REST API]
		        O[Order Export] --> H
		        P[Customer Export] --> H

		        T[Error Logging] --> I
		        U[Progress Monitoring] --> I
		    end
		```
		
		### 1.3 Трехсторонняя синхронизация
		
		**Импорт в FREESPORT (1С → Platform):**
		- Товары и номенклатура
		- Остатки и цены
		- Справочник существующих клиентов
		- Статусы заказов
		
		**Экспорт из FREESPORT (Platform → 1С):**
		- Заказы клиентов
		- Новые покупатели
		- Обновления данных клиентов
		
		**Двусторонняя синхронизация клиентов:**
		- Загрузка существующих клиентов из 1С
		- Передача новых регистраций с сайта в 1С
		- Синхронизация изменений клиентских данных
		
		---
		
		## 2. Архитектурные принципы
		
		### 2.1 Принципы проектирования
		
		1. **Idempotency:** Повторная обработка данных не должна нарушать целостность
		2. **Fault Tolerance:** Система устойчива к временным сбоям интеграции
		3. **Data Consistency:** Приоритет целостности данных над скоростью синхронизации
		4. **Incremental Sync:** Поддержка инкрементальных обновлений
		5. **Audit Trail:** Полное логирование всех операций импорта/экспорта
		6. **Customer Identity Resolution:** Надежное сопоставление клиентов между системами
		
		### 2.2 Выбор технологий
		
		**Формат данных:** *Будет определен после ответа от 1С программиста*
		**Протокол передачи:** *Будет определен после ответа от 1С программиста*  
		**Обработка данных:** Django Management Commands + Celery
		**Хранение состояния:** PostgreSQL + Redis для кэширования
		**Мониторинг:** Structured logging + Django Admin interface
		
		---
		
		## 3. Форматы данных и протоколы
		
		> **ПРИМЕЧАНИЕ:** Этот раздел будет детально проработан после получения ответов от программиста 1С на запрос в `docs/architecture/request-to-1c-developer.md`
		
		### 3.1 Ожидаемые форматы данных
		
		**Возможные варианты:**
		- CommerceML 2.0 (XML стандарт для 1С)
		- JSON через HTTP API
		- CSV файлы
		- Собственный XML формат
		
		### 3.2 Методы передачи данных
		
		**Варианты для согласования:**
		- HTTP/HTTPS API endpoints
		- FTP/SFTP файловый обмен  
		- Веб-сервисы SOAP
		- Файлы в общую сетевую папку
		
		---
		
		## 4. Схемы маппинга данных
		
		> **ПРИМЕЧАНИЕ:** Детальные схемы маппинга будут созданы после получения примеров реальных данных от 1С программиста
		
		### 4.1 Базовые принципы маппинга
		
		**Товары:**
		- `onec_id` как основной ключ связи
		- Маппинг ценовых групп 1С → роли платформы
		- Обработка технических характеристик в JSONB
		
		**Покупатели:**
		- `email` + `onec_id` как составной ключ  
		- Маппинг типов клиентов 1С → роли платформы
		- Разделение данных физ.лиц и юр.лиц

		## 6. Процессы синхронизации
		
		### 6.1 Алгоритм импорта каталога
		
		```python
		def import_catalog_workflow():
		    """Workflow импорта каталога товаров"""
		    
		    # Шаг 1: Валидация файла
		    validate_file_structure()

		    process_brands(brands)
		    
		    # Шаг 6: Создание/обновление товаров
		    for product_chunk in chunk_products(products):
		        process_products_chunk(product_chunk)
		    
		    # Шаг 7: Деактивация отсутствующих товаров
		    deactivate_missing_products()
		    
		    # Шаг 8: Генерация отчета
		    generate_import_report()
		```
		
		### 6.2 Алгоритм импорта цен и остатков
		
		```python
		def import_offers_workflow():
		    """Workflow импорта коммерческих предложений"""
		    
		    # Шаг 1: Валидация файла offers
		    validate_offers_file()
		    
		    # Шаг 2: Парсинг типов цен
		    price_types = parse_price_types()
		    validate_price_types_mapping(price_types)
		    
		    # Шаг 3: Парсинг предложений
		    offers = parse_offers()
		    
		    # Шаг 4: Обновление цен и остатков
		    for offer_chunk in chunk_offers(offers):
		        update_products_prices_and_stock(offer_chunk)
		    
		    # Шаг 5: Проверка целостности данных
		    validate_data_integrity()
		    
		    # Шаг 6: Кэш инвалидация
		    invalidate_product_cache()

		### 10.1 Story 3.1: Анализ требований к интеграции с 1С ✅
		
		**Статус:** Завершено  
		**Deliverables:**
		- ✅ Документ архитектуры интеграции с 1С (данный документ)
		- ✅ Запрос к программисту 1С с детальными вопросами
		- ✅ Архитектура синхронизации покупателей
		- ⏳ Схемы маппинга данных (ожидаем ответ от 1С)
		
		---
		
		### 10.2 Story 3.2: Разработка структуры для импорта данных из 1С
		
		**Техническое задание для Dev Agent (James):**
		
		#### **Создать Django management commands:**
		
		```python
		# apps/products/management/commands/import_catalog_from_1c.py
		class Command(BaseCommand):
		    help = "Импорт каталога товаров из файла 1С"
		    
		    def add_arguments(self, parser):
		        parser.add_argument('--file', required=True, help='Путь к файлу данных')
		        parser.add_argument('--dry-run', action='store_true', help='Тестовый запуск')
		        parser.add_argument('--chunk-size', type=int, default=100, help='Размер пакета')
		
		# apps/products/management/commands/import_offers_from_1c.py
		class Command(BaseCommand):
		    help = "Импорт цен и остатков из файла 1С"
		
		# apps/users/management/commands/import_customers_from_1c.py  
		class Command(BaseCommand):
		    help = "Импорт справочника клиентов из 1С"
		
		# apps/users/management/commands/sync_customers_with_1c.py
		class Command(BaseCommand):
		    help = "Двусторонняя синхронизация клиентов с 1С"
		```
		
		#### **Создать сервисы обработки данных:**
		
		```python
		# apps/products/services/data_parser.py
		class DataParser:
		    """Базовый класс для парсинга данных из 1С"""
		    
		# apps/users/services/customer_sync_service.py
		class CustomerSyncService:
		    """Сервис синхронизации клиентов"""
		    
		# apps/common/services/import_validator.py
		class ImportDataValidator:
		    """Валидатор импортируемых данных"""
		```
		
		#### **Обновить модели:**
		
		```python
		# Добавить поля в User model для интеграции с 1С
		onec_id = models.CharField('ID в 1С', max_length=100, blank=True, null=True, unique=True)
		sync_status = models.CharField('Статус синхронизации', ...)
		created_in_1c = models.BooleanField('Создан в 1С', default=False)
		needs_1c_export = models.BooleanField('Требует экспорта в 1С', default=False)
		
		# Создать модель CustomerSyncLog для логирования
		```

		## Заключение
		
		Данная архитектурная документация предоставляет полную спецификацию для реализации интеграции с 1С в рамках Epic 3, включая критически важный компонент **синхронизации покупателей**.
		
		**Ключевые особенности архитектуры:**
		
		✅ **Трехсторонняя синхронизация:** товары + клиенты + заказы  
		✅ **Разрешение конфликтов:** автоматическое + ручная модерация  
		✅ **Identity Resolution:** надежная идентификация клиентов между системами  
		✅ **Audit Trail:** полное логирование всех операций синхронизации  
		✅ **Performance:** batch операции и оптимизированные запросы  
		✅ **Security:** валидация и защита чувствительных данных клиентов  
		
		**Следующие шаги:**
		1. **Отправить запрос программисту 1С** - получить ответы на технические вопросы
		2. **Доработать разделы 3-4** - форматы данных и схемы маппинга
		3. **Передать Dev Agent (James)** - для реализации Stories 3.2-3.5
		
		**Готово к передаче для разработки! 🚀**</file>

		## Тестирование
		
		### Unit тесты дедупликации
		
		```python
		class TestCartDeduplication:
		    
		    @pytest.mark.unit
		    def test_add_same_product_twice(self):
		        """Добавление одного товара дважды увеличивает количество"""

		        assert created2 is False  # Не создан новый
		        assert item2.id == item1.id  # Тот же объект

		        CartItem.objects.create(cart=cart, product=product, quantity=1, price_snapshot=100)
		        
		        # Попытка создать дубликат напрямую
		        with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
		            CartItem.objects.create(cart=cart, product=product, quantity=1, price_snapshot=100)
		```
		
		### API тесты
		
		```python
		class TestCartAPI:
		    
		    @pytest.mark.integration
		    def test_add_item_deduplication(self, api_client):
		        """API дедупликация при добавлении товара"""
		        product = ProductFactory(retail_price=1000)
		        
		        # Первый запрос
		        response1 = api_client.post('/api/cart/add_item/', {
		            'product_id': product.id,
		            'quantity': 2
		        })
		        
		        assert response1.status_code == 201
		        data1 = response1.json()
		        assert data1['created'] is True
		        assert data1['item']['quantity'] == 2

		        data2 = response2.json()
		        assert data2['created'] is False  # Не создан новый
		        assert data2['item']['quantity'] == 3  # 2 + 1
		        assert data2['total_items'] == 1  # Всего позиций в корзине
		```
		
		## Лучшие практики
		
		### ✅ Что НУЖНО делать
		
		1. **Использовать unique_together** для предотвращения дубликатов на уровне БД
		2. **Сохранять снимок цены** на момент добавления в корзину  
		3. **Поддерживать анонимные корзины** через session_key
		4. **Реализовать слияние корзин** при авторизации
		5. **Валидировать количество** перед добавлением
		
		### ❌ Что НЕ нужно делать
		
		1. **Не полагаться только на frontend валидацию** - дубликаты могут появиться
		2. **Не игнорировать race conditions** при одновременных запросах
		3. **Не забывать про очистку старых корзин** анонимных пользователей
		4. **Не обновлять цены в корзине автоматически** - только по запросу пользователя
		
		## Производительность
		
		### Оптимизация запросов
		
		```python
		# ✅ ХОРОШО: Предзагрузка связанных объектов
		cart_items = CartItem.objects.filter(cart=cart)\
		    .select_related('product', 'product__brand', 'product__category')\
		    .order_by('created_at')
		
		# ❌ ПЛОХО: N+1 запросы
		for item in cart_items:
		    print(item.product.name)  # Отдельный запрос к БД
		    print(item.product.brand.name)  # Еще один запрос
		```
		
		### Кэширование корзины
		
		```python
		def get_cart_total_cached(cart_id):
		    """Кэширование общей суммы корзины"""
		    cache_key = f"cart_total_{cart_id}"
		    total = cache.get(cache_key)
		    
		    if total is None:
		        total = CartItem.objects.filter(cart_id=cart_id)\
		            .aggregate(total=Sum('price_snapshot'))['total'] or 0
		        cache.set(cache_key, total, timeout=300)  # 5 минут
		    
		    return total
		```
		
		Этот паттерн обеспечивает корректную работу корзины и предотвращает проблемы с дублированием товаров!]]></file>

		# Паттерн: Ролевое ценообразование
		
		## Описание
		
		Ключевой архитектурный паттерн FREESPORT для поддержки B2B/B2C модели продаж с различными уровнями цен в зависимости от роли пользователя.
		
		## Роли пользователей
		
		```python
		ROLE_CHOICES = [
		    ('retail', 'Розничный покупатель'),           # Обычные покупатели
		    ('wholesale_level1', 'Оптовик уровень 1'),    # Мелкий опт
		    ('wholesale_level2', 'Оптовик уровень 2'),    # Средний опт  
		    ('wholesale_level3', 'Оптовик уровень 3'),    # Крупный опт
		    ('trainer', 'Тренер'),                        # Тренеры спортклубов
		    ('federation_rep', 'Представитель федерации'), # Спортивные федерации
		    ('admin', 'Администратор'),                   # Системные админы
		]
		```
		
		## Реализация в модели Product
		
		### Поля цен
		
		```python
		class Product(models.Model):
		    # Основная цена (всегда есть)
		    retail_price = models.DecimalField("Розничная цена", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
		    
		    # Оптовые цены (nullable - могут отсутствовать)
		    opt1_price = models.DecimalField("Оптовая цена 1", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		    opt2_price = models.DecimalField("Оптовая цена 2", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)  
		    opt3_price = models.DecimalField("Оптовая цена 3", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		    
		    # Специальные цены
		    trainer_price = models.DecimalField("Цена для тренера", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		    federation_price = models.DecimalField("Цена для федерации", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		    
		    # Информационные цены для B2B (не для продажи)
		    recommended_retail_price = models.DecimalField("RRP", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		    max_suggested_retail_price = models.DecimalField("MSRP", max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		```
		
		### Бизнес-логика
		
		```python
		def get_price_for_user(self, user):
		    """
		    Получить цену товара для конкретного пользователя на основе его роли
		    
		    ПРИНЦИПЫ:
		    1. Fallback к retail_price если специальной цены нет
		    2. Анонимные пользователи получают retail_price  
		    3. Admins получают retail_price (не льготные цены)
		    """
		    if not user or not user.is_authenticated:
		        return self.retail_price
		
		    role_price_mapping = {
		        "retail": self.retail_price,
		        "wholesale_level1": self.opt1_price or self.retail_price,
		        "wholesale_level2": self.opt2_price or self.retail_price, 
		        "wholesale_level3": self.opt3_price or self.retail_price,
		        "trainer": self.trainer_price or self.retail_price,
		        "federation_rep": self.federation_price or self.retail_price,
		        "admin": self.retail_price,  # Админы НЕ получают льготы
		    }
		
		    return role_price_mapping.get(user.role, self.retail_price)
		```
		
		## Применение в API
		
		### ProductSerializer
		
		```python
		class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
		    price = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
		    
		    def get_price(self, obj):
		        """Цена с учетом роли пользователя из запроса"""
		        request = self.context.get('request')
		        user = request.user if request else None
		        return obj.get_price_for_user(user)
		```
		
		### Frontend использование
		
		```typescript
		interface Product {
		  id: number;
		  name: string;
		  price: number;  // Уже учитывает роль пользователя
		  retail_price?: number;  // Только для B2B (показать экономию)
		  recommended_retail_price?: number;  // RRP для B2B
		}
		
		// Компонент цены
		const PriceDisplay: React.FC<{product: Product, userRole: string}> = ({product, userRole}) => {
		  const showDiscount = userRole !== 'retail' && product.retail_price && product.price < product.retail_price;
		  
		  return (
		    <div className="price-container">
		      <span className="current-price text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">
		        {product.price.toLocaleString('ru-RU')} ₽
		      </span>
		      
		      {showDiscount && (
		        <span className="retail-price text-sm text-gray-500 line-through ml-2">
		          {product.retail_price.toLocaleString('ru-RU')} ₽
		        </span>
		      )}
		    </div>
		  );
		};
		```
		
		## Фильтрация по ценам
		
		### Django Filter
		
		```python
		class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
		    min_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(method='filter_by_min_price')
		    max_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(method='filter_by_max_price')
		    
		    def filter_by_min_price(self, queryset, name, value):
		        """Фильтрация по минимальной цене с учетом роли"""
		        user = self.request.user
		        if not user.is_authenticated:
		            return queryset.filter(retail_price__gte=value)
		        
		        # Сложная логика для разных ролей
		        if user.role == 'wholesale_level1':
		            return queryset.filter(
		                Q(opt1_price__gte=value) | 
		                Q(opt1_price__isnull=True, retail_price__gte=value)
		            )
		        # ... аналогично для других ролей
		        
		        return queryset.filter(retail_price__gte=value)
		```
		
		## Тестирование
		
		### Обязательные тесты
		
		```python
		@pytest.mark.parametrize("role,expected_price", [
		    ('retail', Decimal('1000.00')),
		    ('wholesale_level1', Decimal('800.00')), 
		    ('wholesale_level2', Decimal('750.00')),
		    ('trainer', Decimal('900.00')),
		    ('federation_rep', Decimal('700.00')),
		])
		def test_role_based_pricing(role, expected_price):
		    """Тест ролевого ценообразования"""
		    user = UserFactory(role=role)
		    product = ProductFactory(
		        retail_price=Decimal('1000.00'),
		        opt1_price=Decimal('800.00'),
		        opt2_price=Decimal('750.00'),
		        trainer_price=Decimal('900.00'), 
		        federation_price=Decimal('700.00')
		    )
		    
		    assert product.get_price_for_user(user) == expected_price
		
		def test_price_fallback_to_retail():
		    """Fallback к retail_price если специальной цены нет"""
		    user = UserFactory(role='wholesale_level1')
		    product = ProductFactory(
		        retail_price=Decimal('1000.00'),
		        opt1_price=None  # Нет оптовой цены
		    )
		    
		    assert product.get_price_for_user(user) == Decimal('1000.00')
		```
		
		## Миграции
		
		### Добавление новой роли
		
		```python
		# Добавить в User.ROLE_CHOICES новую роль
		# Затем создать миграцию:
		
		def add_new_price_field(apps, schema_editor):
		    """Добавляет новое поле цены для новой роли"""
		    pass
		
		def reverse_add_new_price_field(apps, schema_editor):
		    """Откат изменений"""
		    pass
		
		class Migration(migrations.Migration):
		    operations = [
		        migrations.AddField(
		            model_name='product', 
		            name='new_role_price',
		            field=models.DecimalField('Цена для новой роли', max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
		        ),
		        migrations.RunPython(add_new_price_field, reverse_add_new_price_field),
		    ]
		```
		
		## Лучшие практики
		
		### ✅ Что НУЖНО делать
		
		1. **Всегда fallback к retail_price** если специальной цены нет
		2. **Тестировать все роли** в unit тестах 
		3. **Валидировать цены** - оптовые не могут быть выше розничных
		4. **Логировать ценообразование** в критических местах
		5. **Кэшировать цены** для частых запросов
		
		### ❌ Что НЕ нужно делать
		
		1. **Не хардкодить роли** в коде - использовать константы
		2. **Не показывать все цены** неавторизованным пользователям
		3. **Не давать льготы админам** без явного бизнес-требования  
		4. **Не забывать про nullable поля** при добавлении новых ролей
		5. **Не игнорировать миграции данных** при изменении ролей
		
		## Интеграция с внешними системами
		
		### 1С интеграция
		
		```python
		# При синхронизации с 1С учитывать ролевые цены
		class OneCProductSync:
		    def sync_product_prices(self, onec_data):
		        """Синхронизация цен из 1С"""
		        product = Product.objects.get(onec_id=onec_data['id'])
		        
		        # Маппинг ролей 1С на роли Django
		        price_mapping = {
		            'retail': onec_data.get('retail_price'),
		            'opt1': onec_data.get('wholesale_level1_price'),
		            'opt2': onec_data.get('wholesale_level2_price'),
		            # ...
		        }
		        
		        for role, price in price_mapping.items():
		            if price:
		                setattr(product, f'{role}_price', Decimal(str(price)))
		        
		        product.save()
		```

		## 🎯 Для AI агентов
		
		### Быстрый старт
		1. **Изучите паттерны** - начните с `/patterns/role-based-pricing-pattern.md` 
		2. **Посмотрите примеры** - `/examples/` показывает реальную реализацию
		3. **Используйте шаблоны** - копируйте из `/templates/` для новых компонентов
		
		### Критические правила
		
		#### ✅ ВСЕГДА делайте:
		- Используйте ролевое ценообразование для моделей с ценами
		- Добавляйте `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at` в каждую модель
		- Используйте `unique_together` для предотвращения дубликатов  
		- 🔥 **Используйте полную изоляцию БД** с `clear_db_before_test()` фикстурой
		- 🔥 **Генерируйте уникальные данные** с `get_unique_suffix()` в Factory
		- 🔥 **Маркируйте тесты правильно**: `@pytest.mark.integration` для БД, `@pytest.mark.unit` без БД
		- Тестируйте все 6 обязательных сценариев интеграции с 1С
		- Добавляйте OpenAPI документацию к ViewSet
		
		#### ❌ НИКОГДА не делайте:
		- Не игнорируйте ролевую систему пользователей
		- Не создавайте дубликаты товаров в корзине
		- Не используйте username аутентификацию (только email!)
		- 🚨 **НЕ пишите тесты без полной изоляции БД** (constraint violations!)
		- 🚨 **НЕ используйте статические данные в Factory** (дубликаты ключей!)
		- 🚨 **НЕ маркируйте тесты с БД как `@pytest.mark.unit`**
		- Не забывайте про fallback к retail_price
		- НЕ пропускайте тестирование интеграции с 1С
		
		### Интеграции
		
		#### 1С Integration
		- Используйте поле `onec_id` для связи с 1С
		- Синхронизируйте ролевые цены из 1С
		- Отправляйте заказы обратно в 1С
		
		#### Тестирование 🔥 **ОБНОВЛЕНО**
		- **Unit тесты**: `@pytest.mark.unit` для изолированной логики (БЕЗ БД)
		- **Integration тесты**: `@pytest.mark.integration` для тестов с Factory Boy/API
		- **Изоляция БД**: Обязательная фикстура `clear_db_before_test()` с очисткой кэшей
		- **Уникальные данные**: `get_unique_suffix()` во всех Factory для предотвращения конфликтов
		- **1С интеграция**: 6 обязательных сценариев тестирования (импорт, экспорт, конфликты, fallback)
		
		## 🔄 Процесс обновления
		
		При изменении архитектуры проекта:
		
		1. **Обновите примеры** в `/examples/` при изменении паттернов

		# Стандарты кодирования FREESPORT
		
		## Общие принципы
		
		### Архитектурные принципы
		- **API-First подход**: Все функции должны быть доступны через API перед созданием UI
		- **Separation of Concerns**: Четкое разделение бизнес-логики, представления и доступа к данным  
		- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Избегать дублирования кода через переиспользуемые компоненты
		- **SOLID принципы**: Следование принципам объектно-ориентированного программирования
		- **12-Factor App**: Соблюдение принципов для современных веб-приложений
		
		### Безопасность
		- **НИКОГДА** не включать секреты, ключи API или пароли в код
		- **НИКОГДА** не коммитить конфиденциальные данные в репозиторий
		- Использовать переменные окружения для конфигурации
		- Валидировать все пользовательские данные
		- Следовать принципу наименьших привилегий
		
		## Backend (Django)
		
		### Стиль кода Python
		
		#### Форматирование
		- **Black** для автоматического форматирования кода
		- **Длина строки**: 88 символов (стандарт Black)
		- **Кодировка**: UTF-8 для всех файлов
		
		```bash
		# Форматирование кода
		black .
		
		# Проверка без изменений
		black --check .
		```
		
		#### Импорты
		- **isort** для сортировки импортов
		- Порядок импортов:
		  1. Стандартная библиотека Python
		  2. Сторонние пакеты
		  3. Django импорты
		  4. Локальные импорты приложения
		
		```python
		# Правильный порядок импортов
		import json
		import logging
		from datetime import datetime
		
		import requests
		from django.db import models
		from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
		from rest_framework import serializers
		
		from apps.common.models import BaseModel
		from .utils import calculate_price
		```
		
		#### Линтинг
		- **Flake8** для проверки стиля кода
		- Настройки в `backend/.flake8` или `setup.cfg`
		
		```bash
		# Проверка линтером
		flake8 apps/
		```
		
		#### Типизация
		- **mypy** для статической проверки типов
		- Обязательная типизация для всех публичных методов
		- Настройки в `backend/mypy.ini`
		
		```python
		from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union
		from django.http import JsonResponse
		
		def get_user_data(user_id: int) -> Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, int]]]:
		    """Получает данные пользователя по ID."""
		    try:
		        user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
		        return {
		            'id': user.id,
		            'username': user.username,
		            'email': user.email,
		        }
		    except User.DoesNotExist:
		        return None
		```
		
		### Архитектура Django приложений
		
		#### Структура приложений
		```
		apps/
		├── users/          # Пользователи и аутентификация
		├── products/       # Каталог товаров
		├── orders/         # Система заказов  
		├── cart/          # Корзина покупок
		└── common/        # Общие компоненты
		```
		
		#### Модели (Models)
		```python
		from django.db import models
		from apps.common.models import BaseModel
		
		class Product(BaseModel):
		    """Модель товара."""
		    
		    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, verbose_name="Название")
		    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=255, unique=True)
		    description = models.TextField(blank=True, verbose_name="Описание")
		    
		    # Многоуровневое ценообразование
		    retail_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
		    opt1_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, null=True)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        verbose_name = "Товар"
		        verbose_name_plural = "Товары"
		        ordering = ['name']
		        
		    def __str__(self) -> str:
		        return self.name
		        
		    @property
		    def is_in_stock(self) -> bool:
		        """Проверяет наличие товара на складе."""
		        return self.stock_quantity > 0
		```
		
		#### Сериализаторы (Serializers)
		```python
		from rest_framework import serializers
		from .models import Product
		
		class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
		    """Сериализатор товара."""
		    
		    is_in_stock = serializers.ReadOnlyField()
		    
		    class Meta:
		        model = Product
		        fields = ['id', 'name', 'slug', 'description', 'retail_price', 'is_in_stock']
		        read_only_fields = ['id', 'created_at', 'updated_at']
		        
		    def validate_retail_price(self, value):
		        """Валидация розничной цены."""
		        if value <= 0:
		            raise serializers.ValidationError("Цена должна быть положительной")
		        return value
		```
		
		#### Представления (Views)
		```python
		from rest_framework import viewsets, permissions
		from rest_framework.decorators import action
		from rest_framework.response import Response
		from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
		
		class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
		    """ViewSet для управления товарами."""
		    
		    queryset = Product.objects.all()
		    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
		    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]
		    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]
		    filterset_fields = ['category', 'brand']
		    
		    @action(detail=True, methods=['get'])
		    def stock_status(self, request, pk=None):
		        """Получить статус наличия товара."""
		        product = self.get_object()
		        return Response({
		            'in_stock': product.is_in_stock,
		            'quantity': product.stock_quantity
		        })
		```
		
		### Тестирование
		
		#### Стратегия тестирования
		- **Пирамида тестирования**: Unit > Integration > E2E
		- **Покрытие кода**: минимум 70%, критические модули 90%
		- **Изоляция тестов**: каждый тест должен быть независимым
		
		#### Структура тестов
		```python
		import pytest
		from django.test import TestCase
		from apps.products.models import Product
		
		@pytest.mark.unit
		class TestProductModel(TestCase):
		    """Тесты модели Product."""
		    
		    def setUp(self):
		        """Настройка тестовых данных."""
		        self.product = Product.objects.create(
		            name="Test Product",
		            slug="test-product",
		            retail_price=100.00
		        )
		    
		    def test_str_representation(self):
		        """Тест строкового представления модели."""
		        self.assertEqual(str(self.product), "Test Product")
		        
		    def test_is_in_stock_property(self):
		        """Тест свойства is_in_stock."""
		        self.product.stock_quantity = 5
		        self.assertTrue(self.product.is_in_stock)
		```
		
		## Frontend (Next.js)
		
		### Стиль кода TypeScript
		
		#### ESLint конфигурация
		```javascript
		// eslint.config.mjs
		import { dirname } from "path";
		import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
		import { FlatCompat } from "@eslint/eslintrc";
		
		const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
		const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
		
		const compat = new FlatCompat({
		  baseDirectory: __dirname,
		});
		
		const eslintConfig = [
		  ...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"),
		];
		
		export default eslintConfig;
		```
		
		#### TypeScript стандарты
		```typescript
		// Строгая типизация
		interface User {
		  id: number;
		  username: string;
		  email: string;
		  role: 'retail' | 'wholesale_level1' | 'wholesale_level2' | 'wholesale_level3' | 'trainer' | 'federation_rep' | 'admin';
		}
		
		interface Product {
		  id: number;
		  name: string;
		  slug: string;
		  retail_price: number;
		  opt1_price?: number;
		  is_in_stock: boolean;
		}
		
		// React компонент с типизацией
		interface ProductCardProps {
		  product: Product;
		  onAddToCart: (productId: number) => void;
		}
		
		const ProductCard: React.FC<ProductCardProps> = ({ product, onAddToCart }) => {
		  const handleAddToCart = () => {
		    onAddToCart(product.id);
		  };
		
		  return (
		    <div className="product-card">
		      <h3>{product.name}</h3>
		      <p>Цена: {product.retail_price} ₽</p>
		      {product.is_in_stock && (
		        <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>В корзину</button>
		      )}
		    </div>
		  );
		};
		```
		
		#### Zustand Store
		```typescript
		// stores/cartStore.ts
		import { create } from 'zustand';
		
		interface CartItem {
		  productId: number;
		  quantity: number;
		  price: number;
		}
		
		interface CartState {
		  items: CartItem[];
		  addItem: (productId: number, price: number) => void;
		  removeItem: (productId: number) => void;
		  clearCart: () => void;
		  totalAmount: number;
		}
		
		export const useCartStore = create<CartState>((set, get) => ({
		  items: [],
		  
		  addItem: (productId: number, price: number) => {
		    set((state) => {
		      const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.productId === productId);
		      
		      if (existingItem) {
		        return {
		          items: state.items.map(item =>
		            item.productId === productId 
		              ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + 1 }
		              : item
		          )
		        };
		      }
		      
		      return {
		        items: [...state.items, { productId, quantity: 1, price }]
		      };
		    });
		  },
		  
		  removeItem: (productId: number) => {
		    set((state) => ({
		      items: state.items.filter(item => item.productId !== productId)
		    }));
		  },
		  
		  clearCart: () => set({ items: [] }),
		  
		  get totalAmount() {
		    return get().items.reduce((total, item) => total + (item.price * item.quantity), 0);
		  }
		}));
		```
		
		### Стилизация (Tailwind CSS)
		
		#### Соглашения по классам
		```typescript
		// Использование cn() для условных классов
		import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
		
		interface ButtonProps {
		  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
		  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
		  disabled?: boolean;
		  children: React.ReactNode;
		}
		
		const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
		  variant = 'primary', 
		  size = 'md', 
		  disabled = false, 
		  children 
		}) => {
		  return (
		    <button
		      className={cn(
		        // Базовые стили
		        'rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2',
		        
		        // Варианты
		        {
		          'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-blue-500': variant === 'primary',
		          'bg-gray-600 text-white hover:bg-gray-700 focus:ring-gray-500': variant === 'secondary',
		          'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700 focus:ring-red-500': variant === 'danger',
		        },
		        
		        // Размеры
		        {
		          'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm': size === 'sm',
		          'px-4 py-2 text-base': size === 'md',
		          'px-6 py-3 text-lg': size === 'lg',
		        },
		        
		        // Состояния
		        {
		          'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed': disabled,
		        }
		      )}
		      disabled={disabled}
		    >
		      {children}
		    </button>
		  );
		};
		```
		
		### Тестирование (Jest + React Testing Library)
		
		```typescript
		// __tests__/components/ProductCard.test.tsx
		import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
		import { ProductCard } from '@/components/ProductCard';
		
		const mockProduct = {
		  id: 1,
		  name: 'Test Product',
		  slug: 'test-product',
		  retail_price: 100,
		  is_in_stock: true,
		};
		
		describe('ProductCard', () => {
		  const mockOnAddToCart = jest.fn();
		
		  beforeEach(() => {
		    mockOnAddToCart.mockClear();
		  });
		
		  it('renders product information correctly', () => {
		    render(
		      <ProductCard product={mockProduct} onAddToCart={mockOnAddToCart} />
		    );
		
		    expect(screen.getByText('Test Product')).toBeInTheDocument();
		    expect(screen.getByText('Цена: 100 ₽')).toBeInTheDocument();
		  });
		
		  it('calls onAddToCart when button is clicked', () => {
		    render(
		      <ProductCard product={mockProduct} onAddToCart={mockOnAddToCart} />
		    );
		
		    const addButton = screen.getByText('В корзину');
		    fireEvent.click(addButton);
		
		    expect(mockOnAddToCart).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
		  });
		
		  it('does not show add to cart button when out of stock', () => {
		    const outOfStockProduct = { ...mockProduct, is_in_stock: false };
		    
		    render(
		      <ProductCard product={outOfStockProduct} onAddToCart={mockOnAddToCart} />
		    );
		
		    expect(screen.queryByText('В корзину')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
		  });
		});
		```

		### **Project Brief: Интернет портал компании**
		
		#### **Executive Summary**
		
		Проект "Интернет портал компании" направлен на создание современной, единой платформы для онлайн-продаж пяти торговых марок. Центральной задачей является запуск B2B-функционала, который предоставит оптовым покупателям, тренерам и представителям спортивных федераций единую точку доступа ко всему ассортименту. Платформа также будет обслуживать розничных клиентов.
		
		Архитектура системы будет построена по принципу **API-First (Headless)** с использованием технологического стека: Python (Django) для бэкенда и JavaScript (React) для фронтенда. Это обеспечит прочную основу для масштабирования и расширения функционала в будущем, в том числе для интеграции новых торговых марок, мобильных приложений и сервисов, таких как **1С**.
		
		Разработка будет учитывать высокие нефункциональные требования, включая производительность и безопасность. Портал постепенно заменит существующие сайты четырех торговых марок, предоставляя клиентам унифицированный и функциональный опыт.
		
		#### **Problem Statement**
		
		Существующие сайты для четырех торговых марок компании разрознены и не имеют унифицированного онлайн-канала продаж. Основная проблема заключается в **отсутствии полноценного функционала интернет-магазина** как для розничных, так и для оптовых клиентов. В частности, это касается:
		
		* **B2B-функционала:** На текущих платформах нет возможности для онлайн-заказов оптовыми покупателями, тренерами и представителями спортивных федераций, что усложняет ключевой бизнес-процесс.  
		* **B2C-функционала:** Не реализованы базовые элементы интернет-магазина, такие как корзина, онлайн-оплата, а также не настроена интеграция с остатками товаров в 1С и со службами доставки.
		
		#### **Proposed Solution**
		
		Предлагается разработать единую, современную платформу — "Интернет портал компании" — с архитектурой **API-First (Headless)**. Это решение позволит централизовать все пять торговых марок и предоставить оптовым и розничным покупателям полноценный функционал интернет-магазина.
		
		Основные элементы решения:
		
		* **API-First (Headless):** Бэкенд будет служить ядром системы, предоставляя данные через документированный REST API.  
		* **Унифицированный портал:** Фронтенд станет клиентским SPA-приложением, которое будет взаимодействовать с бэкендом через API, что обеспечит гибкость и независимость.  
		* **Единый каталог:** Будет создан единый каталог товаров, в котором будут представлены все пять торговых марок.  
		* **Полный B2B-функционал:** На портале будет реализован весь необходимый функционал для оптовых клиентов, включая онлайн-заказы, индивидуальные скидки и историю счетов.  
		* **Полный B2C-функционал:** Будет реализован базовый цикл онлайн-продаж для розничных покупателей, включая корзину, оформление заказа на одной или двух страницах и онлайн-оплату через ЮКасса.  
		* **Интеграция с 1С:** Будет реализована двусторонняя интеграция с базой данных 1С, что критично для корректной работы интернет-магазина. Эта интеграция будет включать:  
		  * **Обновление остатков:** Синхронизация остатков товаров в 1С с порталом.  
		  * **Выгрузка заказов:** Автоматическая передача данных о заказах из портала в 1С.  
		  * **Синхронизация статусов:** Обмен данными о статусах заказов (например, "в обработке", "оплачен", "отгружен") между 1С и порталом.
		
		#### **Target Users**
		
		**Primary User Segment: Оптовый покупатель (B2B)**
		
		**Описание:** Магазины и дистрибьюторы, индивидуальные тренеры, спортивные клубы и представители спортивных федераций. Это ключевая аудитория, для которой разработан специализированный функционал, включая доступ к оптовым ценам и специальным возможностям онлайн-заказа.
		
		**Проблемы и потребности:**
		
		* Необходимость в удобном и быстром онлайн-заказе большого объема товаров.  
		* Требуется доступ к специальным ценам и условиям.  
		* Важна возможность просмотра истории счетов и управления реквизитами компании.
		
		**Secondary User Segment: Розничный покупатель (B2C)**
		
		**Описание:** Стандартная роль для всех пользователей по умолчанию. Мужчины и женщины в возрасте 18-45 лет, приобретающие спортивные товары. Каталог включает в себя широкий перечень товаров для различных видов спорта, туризма и активного отдыха.
		
		**Проблемы и потребности:**
		
		* Легкий и интуитивно понятный поиск товаров.  
		* Простой процесс оформления заказа, включая онлайн-оплату.  
		* Возможность сохранить личные данные и историю заказов в личном кабинете.
		
		#### **Goals & Success Metrics**
		
		**Business Objectives**
		
		* **Обеспечить базовый цикл онлайн-продаж:** Запустить полностью работающий процесс онлайн-заказов для B2B- и B2C-клиентов.  
		* **Создать фундамент IT-инфраструктуры (API-First):** Разработать бэкенд, который позволит в будущем легко расширять количество направлений и добавлять новые торговые марки.  
		* **Заменить существующие сайты:** В рамках проекта будет создан новый сайт для торговой марки BOYBO, интегрированный в разрабатываемую платформу. В дальнейшем это позволит поэтапно перевести пользователей с существующих сайтов на новую единую платформу.  
		* **Интегрироваться с базой данных 1С:** Реализовать двусторонний обмен данными для синхронизации остатков товаров, выгрузки заказов из портала и обновления их статусов.
		
		**User Success Metrics**
		
		* **Простота использования:** Пользователи (особенно B2B) могут легко найти нужный товар и оформить заказ.  
		* **Удобство заказа:** Время от добавления товара в корзину до оформления заказа для B2C-клиентов минимально.  
		* **Доступ к информации:** Оптовые клиенты могут просматривать индивидуальные цены и историю счетов.
		
		#### **MVP Scope**
		
		**Core Features (Must Have)**
		
		* **Централизованный каталог товаров:** Объединение всех пяти торговых марок в единый каталог с многоуровневой структурой категорий.  
		* **B2B-функционал:** Разработка ролей "Оптовый покупатель", "Тренер", "Представитель федерации". Для оптовиков будут предусмотрены три категории цен, индивидуальные скидки, минимальное количество для оптового заказа, а также история счетов, управление реквизитами, адресами доставки и выбором способа доставки.  
		* **B2C-функционал:** Полный цикл онлайн-продаж, включая корзину, оформление заказа без регистрации и онлайн-оплату через ЮКасса.  
		* **Регистрация и авторизация:** Разработка функционала регистрации по email и паролю с подтверждением по электронной почте. Для B2B-пользователей после регистрации потребуется дополнительное подтверждение администратором для активации оптовых прав.  
		* **Интеграция с 1С:** Двусторонняя синхронизация для обновления остатков товаров, выгрузки заказов и синхронизации их статусов.  
		* **Управление контентом:** Базовая административная панель для управления заказами, каталогом, пользователями и статическими страницами.

		**Key Assumptions**
		
		* **Унификация брендов:** Все пять торговых марок имеют достаточную степень унификации в бизнес-процессах и товарных характеристиках, чтобы их можно было объединить в единый каталог на одной платформе.  
		* **Интеграция с 1С:** Доступ к базе данных 1С будет предоставлен, и ее структура будет позволять реализовать необходимую двустороннюю синхронизацию.  
		* **Команда и ресурсы:** Есть команда, имеющая необходимый опыт работы с выбранным технологическим стеком (Python/Django, React, PostgreSQL).  
		* **Категории товаров:** Список категорий товаров будет получен из 1С.  
		* **Функционал старых сайтов:** Функционал с существующих сайтов не будет переноситься, а будет реализован согласно ТЗ.  
		* **Миграция данных:** Миграция данных с существующих сайтов на новую платформу не будет осуществляться.  
		* **Регистрация B2B-клиентов:** При регистрации обязательны поля: Имя, Фирма, эл.почта, телефон. После регистрации и подтверждения администратором, B2B-клиент заполняет дополнительные обязательные поля \- ИНН, КПП, Юр. адрес, адрес доставки, банковские реквизиты.
		
		#### **Risks & Open Questions**
		
		**Key Risks**
		
		* **Риск интеграции с 1С:** Интеграция с базой данных 1С может оказаться более сложной и трудоемкой, чем предполагалось, что может повлиять на сроки и бюджет.  
		* **Риск унификации брендов:** Пять торговых марок могут иметь настолько разные бизнес-логику или данные, что их объединение в единый каталог потребует дополнительных работ.  
		* **Риск превышения бюджета/сроков:** Заявленные бюджет (€9600) и сроки (20 недель) являются очень оптимистичными для проекта такого масштаба, и есть риск их превышения.  
		* **Риск B2B-функционала:** Требования оптовых клиентов могут оказаться шире, чем предусмотрено в MVP, что приведет к расширению объема работ.
		
		**Areas Needing Further Research**
		
		* **Анализ данных 1С:** Требуется детальное изучение структуры и доступности базы данных 1С для планирования интеграции.
		
		#### **Next Steps**
		
		**Immediate Actions**
		
		1. Утверждение данного брифа проекта.  
		2. Передача брифа проекта Product Manager'у для начала работы над Product Requirements Document (PRD).]]></file>

		## Бизнес-Правила
		
		### Роли пользователей и ценообразование
		- **retail**: Розничный покупатель - retail_price
		- **wholesale_level1**: Оптовик уровень 1 - opt1_price
		- **wholesale_level2**: Оптовик уровень 2 - opt2_price  
		- **wholesale_level3**: Оптовик уровень 3 - opt3_price
		- **trainer**: Тренер - trainer_price
		- **federation_rep**: Представитель федерации - federation_price
		- **admin**: Администратор - полный доступ
		
		### Информационные цены (только для отображения B2B пользователям)
		- **recommended_retail_price**: Рекомендованная розничная цена (RRP)
		- **max_suggested_retail_price**: Максимальная рекомендованная цена (MSRP)
		
		### Статусы заказов
		- **pending**: Ожидает обработки

		3. **Заказы пользователя**: (user_id, created_at DESC)
		4. **Запросы по складу**: (sku, stock_quantity)
		5. **Активные товары**: (is_active, category_id)
		
		### Оптимизация запросов
		- Используем select_related/prefetch_related для оптимизации JOIN
		- Партицирование больших таблиц по дате
		- Кеширование часто запрашиваемых данных
		- Индексы для поддержки пользовательских ролей и ценообразования]]></file>

		# Story 2.1: API Documentation (Swagger) - Принятые технические решения
		
		**Дата:** 16 августа 2025  
		**Статус:** COMPLETED  
		**Разработчик:** Claude Sonnet 4
		
		## Обзор
		
		Документ описывает ключевые технические и архитектурные решения, принятые при реализации Story 2.1: API Documentation с автоматической генерацией Swagger/OpenAPI документации.
		
		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Выбор OpenAPI 3.1.0 вместо 3.0
		
		**Решение:** Миграция с OpenAPI 3.0 на OpenAPI 3.1.0
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Соответствие современным стандартам API документации
		- Улучшенная поддержка JSON Schema
		- Готовность к webhook интеграциям (ЮКасса)
		- Требование архитектурной документации (п.3 "Спецификация API")
		
		**Техническая реализация:**
		- Обновление drf-spectacular с v0.27.0 до v0.28.0
		- Установка 'OAS_VERSION': '3.1.0' в SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS
		- Обновление всех связанных документов проекта
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Оставить OpenAPI 3.0 - отклонено из-за архитектурных требований
		- Использовать другие инструменты документации - отклонено из-за экосистемы Django
		
		### 2. Выбор drf-spectacular для генерации документации
		
		**Решение:** Использование drf-spectacular вместо drf-yasg
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Активная поддержка и развитие
		- Нативная поддержка OpenAPI 3.1.0
		- Лучшая интеграция с Django REST Framework
		- Более богатые возможности кастомизации UI
		
		**Конфигурация:**
		```python
		SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS = {
		    'TITLE': 'FREESPORT API',
		    'DESCRIPTION': 'API для B2B/B2C платформы спортивных товаров',
		    'VERSION': '1.0.0',
		    'SERVE_INCLUDE_SCHEMA': False,
		    'OAS_VERSION': '3.1.0',
		    # Расширенные настройки UI и серверов
		}
		```
		
		### 3. Структура эндпоинтов документации
		
		**Решение:** Три отдельных эндпоинта для разных типов потребления
		
		**Эндпоинты:**
		- `/api/schema/` - машиночитаемая OpenAPI схема (JSON)
		- `/api/docs/` - интерактивный Swagger UI для разработчиков
		- `/api/redoc/` - читаемая документация для пользователей API
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Разделение машиночитаемой и человекочитаемой документации
		- Swagger UI для интерактивного тестирования

		# Story 2.2: User Management API - Принятые технические решения
		
		**Дата:** 16 августа 2025  
		**Статус:** COMPLETED  
		**Разработчик:** Claude Sonnet 4
		
		## Обзор
		
		Документ описывает ключевые технические и архитектурные решения, принятые при реализации Story 2.2: User Management API с ролевой системой B2B/B2C и JWT аутентификацией.
		
		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Email-based аутентификация вместо username
		
		**Решение:** Использование email как USERNAME_FIELD в кастомной User модели
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Email более естественен для пользователей B2B/B2C
		- Уникальность email гарантирует отсутствие коллизий
		- Соответствует современным практикам UX
		- Упрощение процесса восстановления паролей
		
		**Техническая реализация:**
		```python
		class User(AbstractUser):
		    username = None  # Отключаем username
		    email = models.EmailField('Email адрес', unique=True)
		    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
		    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
		```
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Дублирование username и email - отклонено из-за избыточности
		- Использование phone как альтернативного логина - отложено на будущее
		
		### 2. Ролевая система для B2B/B2C пользователей
		
		**Решение:** 6-уровневая система ролей с различными уровнями доступа
		
		**Роли реализованы:**
		- **retail** - Розничный покупатель (базовые цены)
		- **wholesale_level1/2/3** - Оптовики трех уровней (оптовые цены)
		- **trainer** - Тренер/Фитнес-клуб (специальные цены)
		- **federation_rep** - Представитель федерации (федеральные цены)
		- **admin** - Администратор (полный доступ)
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Соответствие бизнес-требованиям многоуровневого ценообразования
		- Гибкость для добавления новых ролей в будущем
		- Четкое разделение B2B и B2C функциональности
		
		**Код реализации:**
		```python
		ROLE_CHOICES = [
		    ('retail', 'Розничный покупатель'),
		    ('wholesale_level1', 'Оптовик уровень 1'),
		    ('wholesale_level2', 'Оптовик уровень 2'),
		    ('wholesale_level3', 'Оптовик уровень 3'),
		    ('trainer', 'Тренер/Фитнес-клуб'),
		    ('federation_rep', 'Представитель федерации'),
		    ('admin', 'Администратор'),
		]
		```
		
		### 3. JWT токенизация для stateless аутентификации
		
		**Решение:** django-rest-framework-simplejwt для токенной аутентификации
		
		**Параметры токенов:**
		- Access token: 60 минут (баланс безопасности/удобства)
		- Refresh token: 7 дней (разумный период для переавторизации)
		- Алгоритм: HS256 (достаточная безопасность для внутреннего API)
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Stateless архитектура лучше масштабируется
		- Мобильные приложения требуют токенной аутентификации
		- Микросервисная архитектура в будущем
		- Простота интеграции с фронтенд фреймворками
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Session-based аутентификация - отклонено из-за scaling ограничений
		- OAuth2 - избыточно для внутреннего API
		- Более длительные токены - отклонено из соображений безопасности
		
		### 4. Валидация B2B полей
		
		**Решение:** Условная валидация company_name и tax_id для B2B ролей
		
		**Логика валидации:**
		```python
		def validate(self, data):
		    role = data.get('role', 'retail')
		    b2b_roles = ['wholesale_level1', 'wholesale_level2', 'wholesale_level3', 'trainer', 'federation_rep']
		    
		    if role in b2b_roles:
		        if not data.get('company_name'):
		            raise ValidationError("Название компании обязательно для B2B пользователей")
		        if not data.get('tax_id'):
		            raise ValidationError("ИНН обязателен для B2B пользователей")
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Юридические требования для B2B операций
		- Валидация на уровне API предотвращает некорректные данные
		- Гибкость для различных типов организаций
		
		## Технические решения
		
		### 1. Кастомный UserManager для email аутентификации
		
		**Решение:** Переопределение create_user и create_superuser методов
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		class UserManager(BaseUserManager):
		    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
		        if not email:
		            raise ValueError('Email обязателен для создания пользователя')
		        
		        email = self.normalize_email(email)
		        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
		        user.set_password(password)
		        user.save(using=self._db)
		        return user
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Обеспечивает корректную работу Django admin
		- Правильная обработка создания суперпользователей
		- Валидация email на уровне менеджера
		
		### 2. Модульная организация views
		
		**Решение:** Разделение views на логические модули в apps/users/views/
		
		**Структура:**
		- `authentication.py` - регистрация, логин, refresh токенов
		- `profile.py` - управление профилем пользователя
		- `misc.py` - вспомогательные эндпоинты (роли)
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Улучшенная читаемость кода
		- Упрощение поддержки и развития
		- Логическое разделение ответственности
		- Подготовка к масштабированию команды
		
		### 3. Comprehensive сериализаторы
		
		**Решение:** 5 специализированных сериализаторов для разных операций

		- CSRF: Токенная аутентификация не подвержена CSRF
		- Brute Force: Планируется rate limiting (следующие stories)
		
		### 3. Валидация входных данных
		
		**Решение:** Многоуровневая валидация через DRF serializers
		
		**Уровни валидации:**
		1. Field-level validation (тип данных, формат)
		2. Object-level validation (бизнес-правила)
		3. Custom validators (телефон, ИНН формат)
		4. Database constraints (уникальность email)
		
		## Интеграционные решения
		
		### 1. Подготовка к Company модели
		
		**Решение:** B2B поля в User модели как временное решение
		
		**Планируемая эволюция:**
		```python
		# Текущее состояние
		class User(AbstractUser):
		    company_name = models.CharField(...)
		    tax_id = models.CharField(...)
		
		# Будущая архитектура
		class Company(models.Model):
		    user = models.OneToOneField(User)

		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Модульная организация views
		
		**Решение:** Рефакторинг apps/users/views.py в структуру модулей
		
		**Новая структура:**
		```
		apps/users/views/
		├── __init__.py
		├── authentication.py    # Регистрация, логин, refresh
		├── profile.py          # Профиль пользователя  
		├── personal_cabinet.py # Дашборд, адреса, избранное
		└── misc.py            # Служебные endpoints (роли)
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Улучшенная читаемость и навигация по коду
		- Логическое разделение ответственности

		### 2. Агрегированный дашборд для B2B/B2C пользователей
		
		**Решение:** Единый endpoint с дифференцированной логикой по ролям
		
		**Структура дашборда:**
		```python
		# Общие данные для всех пользователей
		{
		    "user_info": {...},
		    "orders_count": 0,
		    "favorites_count": 2,
		    "addresses_count": 1,
		}
		
		# Дополнительные данные для B2B
		{
		    "total_order_amount": "0.00",
		    "avg_order_amount": "0.00",

		### 3. Система управления адресами
		
		**Решение:** Отдельная Address модель с типами адресов и логикой по умолчанию
		
		**Типы адресов:**
		- `shipping` - Адрес доставки
		- `legal` - Юридический адрес (для B2B)
		
		**Логика адреса по умолчанию:**
		```python
		def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
		    if self.is_default:
		        # Автоматически снимаем флаг default с других адресов пользователя
		        Address.objects.filter(
		            user=self.user, 
		            address_type=self.address_type
		        ).update(is_default=False)
		    super().save(*args, **kwargs)
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Поддержка множественных адресов критична для B2B
		- Автоматическое управление default адресом предотвращает ошибки
		- Разделение типов адресов упрощает юридические процессы
		
		### 4. Система избранного (Favorites)
		
		**Решение:** Many-to-Many связь через промежуточную модель Favorite
		
		**Архитектура:**
		```python
		class Favorite(models.Model):
		    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
		    product = models.ForeignKey(Product)
		    added_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        unique_together = ('user', 'product')
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Уникальное ограничение предотвращает дублирование
		- Временная метка позволяет сортировку по дате добавления
		- Простота добавления дополнительных полей (заметки, теги)
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- ManyToManyField без through модели - отклонено из-за ограниченности
		- JSON поле в User модели - отклонено из-за производительности
		
		## Технические решения
		
		### 1. Валидация российских почтовых индексов
		
		**Решение:** RegexValidator для 6-значных индексов
		
		**Паттерн:** `^\d{6}$`
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Соответствие российским стандартам почтовых индексов
		- Предотвращение ошибок при интеграции с службами доставки
		- Подготовка к автоматическому определению регионов

		    regex=r'^\d{6}$',
		    message="Почтовый индекс должен состоять из 6 цифр"
		)
		```
		
		### 2. Permissions и фильтрация данных
		
		**Решение:** Автоматическая фильтрация по текущему пользователю во всех ViewSets
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		class AddressViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
		    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
		    
		    def get_queryset(self):
		        return Address.objects.filter(user=self.request.user)
		    
		    def perform_create(self, serializer):
		        serializer.save(user=self.request.user)
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Гарантированная безопасность данных пользователей
		- Предотвращение случайного доступа к чужим данным
		- Упрощение логики во frontend
		
		### 3. Оптимизация запросов для избранного
		
		**Решение:** Использование select_related для загрузки данных товаров
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def get_queryset(self):
		    return Favorite.objects.filter(user=self.request.user).select_related(
		        'product', 'product__brand', 'product__category'
		    ).order_by('-added_at')
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Избежание N+1 запросов при получении списка избранного
		- Загрузка всех необходимых данных в одном запросе
		- Улучшенная производительность для больших списков
		
		### 4. Временные заглушки с документированием
		
		**Решение:** Создание заглушек для интеграции с будущими stories
		
		**Заглушки реализованы:**
		- `orders_count` - будет интегрирован в Story 2.7
		- `total_order_amount` - агрегация из Order модели
		- `avg_order_amount` - вычисляемое поле
		
		**Документирование:**
		```python
		# TODO_TEMPORARY_FIXES.md
		# Story 2.3 временные заглушки для интеграции с Order API
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Полнота API для фронтенд разработки
		- Четкое планирование будущих интеграций
		- Предотвращение breaking changes
		
		## Решения по интеграции
		
		### 1. Связь с Product API

		        raise ValidationError("Нельзя добавить неактивный товар в избранное")
		    return value
		```
		
		### 2. Подготовка к Order API
		
		**Решение:** Структурирование дашборда для легкой интеграции с заказами
		
		**Подготовленные поля:**
		- `orders_count` - количество заказов пользователя
		- `total_order_amount` - общая сумма заказов
		- `avg_order_amount` - средний чек
		
		**Планируемая интеграция:**
		```python
		# Story 2.7 - реальная реализация
		orders_qs = Order.objects.filter(user=user)
		dashboard_data.update({
		    'orders_count': orders_qs.count(),
		    'total_order_amount': orders_qs.aggregate(
		        total=Sum('total_amount')
		    )['total'] or Decimal('0.00'),
		})
		```
		
		### 3. Ролевая интеграция

		# Story 2.4: Catalog API - Принятые технические решения
		
		**Дата:** 17 августа 2025  
		**Статус:** COMPLETED  
		**Разработчик:** Claude Sonnet 4
		
		## Обзор
		
		Документ описывает ключевые технические и архитектурные решения, принятые при реализации Story 2.4: Catalog API с ролевым ценообразованием, фильтрацией и иерархическими категориями.
		
		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Ролевое ценообразование в каталоге
		
		**Решение:** Динамическая адаптация цен на основе роли пользователя в сериализаторах
		
		**Логика ценообразования:**
		```python
		def get_current_price(self, obj):
		    request = self.context.get('request')
		    if request and hasattr(request, 'user') and request.user.is_authenticated:
		        return obj.get_price_for_user(request.user)
		    return obj.retail_price  # Для анонимных пользователей
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Автоматическая адаптация к роли пользователя без дублирования логики
		- Безопасность - каждый пользователь видит только свои цены
		- Единообразие с системой ценообразования во всей платформе
		- Простота поддержки и изменения правил ценообразования
		
		**Ролевые цены:**
		- retail → retail_price (базовая цена)
		- wholesale_level1 → opt1_price (1-й уровень оптовых цен)
		- wholesale_level2 → opt2_price (2-й уровень оптовых цен)  
		- wholesale_level3 → opt3_price (3-й уровень оптовых цен)
		- trainer → trainer_price (специальная цена для тренеров)
		- federation_rep → federation_price (федеральная цена)
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Отдельные endpoints для каждой роли - отклонено из-за дублирования
		- Передача роли как параметра - отклонено из соображений безопасности
		
		### 2. B2B информационные цены
		
		**Решение:** Условное отображение RRP и MSRP только для B2B пользователей
		
		**Логика отображения:**
		```python
		def get_recommended_retail_price(self, obj):
		    request = self.context.get('request')
		    if (request and hasattr(request, 'user') and 
		        request.user.is_authenticated and 
		        request.user.role in ['wholesale_level1', 'wholesale_level2', 'wholesale_level3', 'trainer', 'federation_rep']):
		        return obj.recommended_retail_price
		    return None
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- RRP/MSRP критически важны для B2B клиентов при планировании наценки
		- Retail покупатели не нуждаются в этой информации
		- Конфиденциальность коммерческой информации
		- Соответствие бизнес-требованиям FREESPORT
		
		### 3. Иерархические категории с навигацией
		
		**Решение:** Рекурсивная структура категорий с breadcrumbs и подсчетом товаров
		
		**Архитектура категорий:**
		```python
		class Category(models.Model):
		    parent = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True)
		    
		    @property
		    def breadcrumbs(self):
		        breadcrumbs = []
		        current = self
		        while current:
		            breadcrumbs.insert(0, {'id': current.id, 'name': current.name})
		            current = current.parent
		        return breadcrumbs
		```
		
		**Features реализованы:**
		- Неограниченная вложенность категорий
		- Автоматическая генерация навигационной цепочки
		- Подсчет активных товаров в каждой категории
		- Список дочерних категорий для навигации
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Гибкость для сложных каталогов спортивных товаров
		- Улучшенная навигация для пользователей
		- SEO оптимизация через структурированные данные
		- Подготовка к фасетному поиску
		
		### 4. Комплексная фильтрация товаров
		
		**Решение:** django-filter для декларативной фильтрации с custom логикой
		
		**Установка зависимости:**
		```bash
		pip install django-filter==23.5
		```
		
		**Реализованные фильтры:**
		- `category_id` - фильтрация по категории
		- `brand` - по ID или slug бренда  
		- `min_price`/`max_price` - ценовой диапазон с учетом роли
		- `in_stock` - только товары в наличии
		- `is_featured` - рекомендуемые товары
		- `search` - полнотекстовый поиск
		
		**Умная ценовая фильтрация:**
		```python
		def filter_by_price_range(self, queryset, name, value):
		    request = self.request
		    user = request.user if request.user.is_authenticated else None
		    
		    # Определяем поле цены на основе роли пользователя
		    price_field = self.get_price_field_for_user(user)
		    
		    if name == 'min_price':
		        return queryset.filter(**{f'{price_field}__gte': value})
		    elif name == 'max_price':
		        return queryset.filter(**{f'{price_field}__lte': value})
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Фильтрация по актуальным для пользователя ценам
		- Высокая производительность через database-level фильтрацию
		- Расширяемость для новых типов фильтров
		- Интеграция с Django ORM для оптимизации запросов
		
		## Технические решения
		
		### 1. Оптимизация производительности запросов
		
		**Решение:** Comprehensive использование select_related и prefetch_related
		
		**Оптимизации в ProductViewSet:**
		```python
		def get_queryset(self):
		    return Product.objects.filter(is_active=True).select_related(
		        'brand', 'category'
		    ).prefetch_related(
		        'category__parent'  # Для breadcrumbs
		    )
		```
		
		**Оптимизации в CategoryViewSet:**
		```python
		def get_queryset(self):
		    return Category.objects.filter(is_active=True).prefetch_related(
		        'children'  # Для дочерних категорий
		    )
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Критическая важность производительности для каталогов
		- Избежание N+1 проблем при загрузке связанных данных
		- Масштабируемость для больших каталогов (>10k товаров)
		- Минимизация нагрузки на database
		
		### 2. Полнотекстовый поиск
		
		**Решение:** Поиск по множественным полям через Django ORM
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def filter_search(self, queryset, name, value):
		    return queryset.filter(
		        Q(name__icontains=value) |
		        Q(sku__icontains=value) |
		        Q(description__icontains=value) |
		        Q(brand__name__icontains=value)
		    )
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Простота реализации без внешних зависимостей
		- Достаточная функциональность для MVP
		- Подготовка к миграции на Elasticsearch в будущем
		- Case-insensitive поиск по ключевым полям
		
		**Планируемые улучшения:**
		- PostgreSQL Full Text Search
		- Elasticsearch для advanced поиска
		- Поиск по synonyms и автокомплит
		
		### 3. Сортировка товаров
		
		**Решение:** Множественные опции сортировки через OrderingFilter
		
		**Доступные сортировки:**
		- `name` / `-name` - по названию (A-Z / Z-A)
		- `price` / `-price` - по цене (возрастание/убывание)
		- `created_at` / `-created_at` - по дате добавления (новые/старые)
		
		**Динамическая сортировка по цене:**
		```python
		def get_ordering(self):
		    ordering = self.request.query_params.get('ordering', '-created_at')
		    
		    if 'price' in ordering:
		        # Определяем поле цены на основе роли пользователя
		        price_field = self.get_price_field_for_user(self.request.user)
		        return ordering.replace('price', price_field)
		    
		    return ordering
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Сортировка по актуальным для пользователя ценам
		- Стандартные UX паттерны для e-commerce
		- Высокая производительность через database sorting
		
		### 4. Пагинация каталога
		
		**Решение:** PageNumberPagination с настраиваемым размером страницы
		
		**Конфигурация:**
		```python
		REST_FRAMEWORK = {
		    'PAGE_SIZE': 20,
		    'PAGE_SIZE_QUERY_PARAM': 'page_size',
		    'MAX_PAGE_SIZE': 100
		}
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Контроль нагрузки на сервер при больших каталогах
		- Улучшенный UX через постепенную загрузку
		- Flexibility для разных устройств (мобильные vs десктоп)
		
		## Решения по интеграции
		
		### 1. Brands API
		
		**Решение:** Простой список активных брендов с базовой информацией
		
		**Структура ответа:**
		```json
		{
		    "id": 1,
		    "name": "Nike",
		    "slug": "nike",
		    "logo": "/media/brands/nike.png",
		    "website": "https://nike.com"
		}
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Поддержка фильтрации товаров по брендам
		- Подготовка к брендовым страницам
		- Минимальная необходимая информация для каталога
		
		### 2. Categories Tree API

		**Структура ответа:**
		```json
		{
		    "id": 1,
		    "name": "Спорт",
		    "children": [
		        {
		            "id": 2,
		            "name": "Футбол",
		            "children": []
		        }
		    ]
		}
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Оптимизация для frontend навигационных меню
		- Отдельный кэш для структуры категорий
		- Упрощение рендеринга дерева на клиенте
		
		### 3. Интеграция с User API
		
		**Решение:** Использование request.user для определения роли и цен
		
		**Преимущества:**
		- Единая точка истины для ролевой логики
		- Автоматическая синхронизация с изменениями ролей
		- Безопасность через контекст запроса
		
		## Решения по тестированию
		
		### 1. Ролевое ценообразование

		```python
		def test_role_based_pricing():
		    # Тест разных цен для разных ролей
		    retail_user = create_user(role='retail')
		    wholesale_user = create_user(role='wholesale_level2')
		    
		    # Проверка цен в каталоге
		    retail_response = get_catalog(retail_user)
		    wholesale_response = get_catalog(wholesale_user)
		    
		    assert retail_response.data[0]['current_price'] == '3000.00'
		    assert wholesale_response.data[0]['current_price'] == '2500.00'
		```
		
		### 2. Фильтрация и поиск
		
		**Покрытие тестами:**

		**Статус:** COMPLETED  
		**Разработчик:** Claude Sonnet 4
		
		## Обзор
		
		Документ описывает ключевые технические и архитектурные решения, принятые при реализации Story 2.5: Product Detail API с расширенными данными, ролевым ценообразованием и галереей изображений.
		
		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Расширение Product модели спецификациями
		
		**Решение:** Добавление JSON поля specifications в Product модель
		
		**Миграция:**
		```python
		# 0005_product_specifications.py
		operations = [
		    migrations.AddField(
		        model_name='product',
		        name='specifications',
		        field=models.JSONField(blank=True, default=dict, verbose_name='Технические характеристики'),
		    ),
		]
		```
		
		**Структура спецификаций:**
		```json
		{
		    "material": "100% полиэстер",
		    "size_range": "XS-XXL", 
		    "weight": "150г",
		    "color_options": ["Черный", "Белый", "Синий"],

		- EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) модель - отклонено из-за производительности
		
		### 2. Структурированная галерея изображений
		
		**Решение:** ProductImageSerializer для унификации обработки изображений
		
		**Архитектура:**
		```python
		class ProductImageSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
		    url = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
		    alt_text = serializers.SerializerMethodField() 
		    is_primary = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
		    
		    def get_alt_text(self, image_data):
		        if image_data.get('is_main'):
		            return f"{self.instance.name} - основное изображение"
		        return f"{self.instance.name} - дополнительное изображение"
		```
		
		**Структура gallery_images JSON:**
		```json
		[
		    {
		        "url": "/media/products/nike-shirt-1.jpg",
		        "alt_text": "Nike футболка - вид спереди",
		        "is_primary": false
		    },
		    {
		        "url": "/media/products/nike-shirt-2.jpg", 
		        "alt_text": "Nike футболка - вид сзади",
		        "is_primary": false
		    }
		]
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- SEO оптимизация через правильные alt тексты
		- Структурированные данные для frontend отображения

		- Простота добавления метаданных (размер, цвет, ракурс)
		
		### 3. Расширенное ролевое ценообразование
		
		**Решение:** Полная информация о ценах с расчетом скидок для каждой роли
		
		**Ценовая структура:**
		```python
		def get_price_info(self, obj):
		    request = self.context.get('request')
		    user = request.user if request and request.user.is_authenticated else None
		    
		    price_info = {
		        'current_price': self.format_decimal(obj.get_price_for_user(user)),
		        'retail_price': self.format_decimal(obj.retail_price),
		    }
		    
		    # B2B информационные цены
		    if user and user.role in self.B2B_ROLES:
		        price_info.update({
		            'recommended_retail_price': self.format_decimal(obj.recommended_retail_price),
		            'max_suggested_retail_price': self.format_decimal(obj.max_suggested_retail_price),
		        })
		    
		    # Расчет скидки от retail_price
		    if obj.retail_price and obj.get_price_for_user(user) < obj.retail_price:
		        discount = ((obj.retail_price - obj.get_price_for_user(user)) / obj.retail_price) * 100
		        price_info['discount_percent'] = round(discount, 1)
		    
		    return price_info
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Прозрачность ценообразования для B2B клиентов
		- Мотивация к покупке через отображение скидки
		- Единообразие с каталогом, но с расширенной информацией
		- Подготовка к системе динамических скидок
		
		### 4. Связанные товары (Related Products)
		
		**Решение:** Автоматический подбор по категории и бренду с исключением текущего товара
		
		**Алгоритм подбора:**
		```python
		def get_related_products(self, obj):
		    related_products = Product.objects.filter(
		        category=obj.category,
		        brand=obj.brand,
		        is_active=True
		    ).exclude(
		        id=obj.id
		    ).select_related(
		        'brand', 'category'
		    )[:5]
		    
		    # Применяем ролевое ценообразование к связанным товарам
		    return ProductListSerializer(
		        related_products, 
		        many=True, 
		        context=self.context
		    ).data
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Увеличение среднего чека через cross-selling
		- Релевантность через категорию и бренд
		- Ограничение 5 товаров предотвращает перегрузку UI
		- Ролевое ценообразование сохраняется для связанных товаров
		
		**Планируемые улучшения:**
		- ML-алгоритмы для персонализированных рекомендаций
		- A/B тестирование алгоритмов подбора
		- Интеграция с историей покупок
		
		## Технические решения
		
		### 1. Унифицированный формат цен
		
		**Решение:** Стандартизация всех цен с 2 десятичными знаками
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def format_decimal(self, value):
		    if value is None:
		        return None
		    return f"{value:.2f}"
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Консистентность отображения цен во всем API
		- Предотвращение проблем с floating point арифметикой
		- Готовность к международным валютам
		- Стандартизация для финансовых расчетов
		
		### 2. Computed Properties интеграция
		
		**Решение:** Использование существующих computed properties из Product модели
		
		**Интегрированные properties:**
		- `is_in_stock` - наличие на складе (stock_quantity > 0)
		- `can_be_ordered` - возможность заказа (учитывает is_active + is_in_stock)
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Повторное использование бизнес-логики из модели
		- Единообразие логики во всей системе
		- Упрощение поддержки при изменении правил
		
		### 3. SEO оптимизация
		
		**Решение:** Включение SEO метаданных в API ответ

		**Стратегии обработки:**
		```python
		def get_gallery_images(self, obj):
		    if not obj.gallery_images:
		        return []
		    return self.process_gallery_images(obj.gallery_images)
		
		def get_specifications(self, obj):
		    return obj.specifications or {}
		
		def get_related_products(self, obj):
		    # Возвращаем пустой список если нет связанных товаров
		    return related_data or []
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Устойчивость к неполным данным
		- Улучшенный UX через отсутствие ошибок
		- Готовность к миграции существующих товаров
		
		## Решения по интеграции
		
		### 1. Навигационная цепочка (Breadcrumbs)
		
		**Решение:** Интеграция с Category модели для полной навигации
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def get_category_info(self, obj):
		    if not obj.category:
		        return None
		    
		    return {
		        'id': obj.category.id,
		        'name': obj.category.name,
		        'slug': obj.category.slug,

		    }
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Улучшенная навигация для пользователей
		- SEO преимущества через структурированную навигацию
		- Интеграция с существующей логикой категорий
		
		### 2. Brand информация
		
		**Решение:** Расширенная информация о бренде товара
		
		**Структура brand_info:**
		```python
		{
		    "id": 1,
		    "name": "Nike",
		    "slug": "nike", 
		    "logo": "/media/brands/nike.png",
		    "website": "https://nike.com"
		}
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Возможность перехода на страницу бренда
		- Брендинг и доверие покупателей
		- Подготовка к брендовым промо-страницам
		
		### 3. Интеграция с Favorites API
		
		**Решение:** Подготовка к отображению статуса "в избранном"
		
		**Планируемая интеграция:**
		```python
		def get_is_favorite(self, obj):
		    request = self.context.get('request')
		    if request and request.user.is_authenticated:
		        return Favorite.objects.filter(
		            user=request.user, 
		            product=obj
		        ).exists()
		    return False
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Улучшенный UX через показ статуса избранного
		- Быстрое добавление/удаление из избранного
		- Персонализация страницы товара
		
		## Решения по тестированию
		
		### 1. Comprehensive функциональное тестирование
		
		**Тестовые сценарии:**
		```python
		def test_product_detail_complete():
		    # Тест всех полей в ответе
		    response = self.client.get(f'/api/v1/products/{self.product.id}/')
		    
		    assert 'specifications' in response.data
		    assert 'gallery_images' in response.data
		    assert 'related_products' in response.data
		    assert 'current_price' in response.data
		    assert 'category_info' in response.data
		```
		
		### 2. Ролевое ценообразование
		
		**Покрытие всех ролей:**
		```python
		def test_role_based_pricing_detail():
		    roles_prices = [
		        ('retail', '3000.00'),
		        ('wholesale_level1', '2800.00'),
		        ('wholesale_level2', '2500.00'),
		        ('trainer', '2200.00'),
		    ]
		    
		    for role, expected_price in roles_prices:
		        user = create_user(role=role)
		        response = get_product_detail(user, self.product.id)
		        assert response.data['current_price'] == expected_price
		```
		
		### 3. Граничные случаи
		
		**Edge cases тестирование:**
		- Товар без изображений
		- Товар без спецификаций  
		- Товар без связанных товаров
		- Неактивный товар (404 response)
		- Товар с некорректными ценами
		
		## Производственные соображения
		
		### 1. Кэширование
		
		**Стратегия кэширования:**
		- Полная страница товара для анонимных пользователей
		- Персонализированное кэширование по ролям
		- Cache invalidation при изменении товара
		
		**Реализация (планируемая):**
		```python
		@method_decorator(cache_page(60 * 15))  # 15 минут для анонимных
		def retrieve(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		    if not request.user.is_authenticated:
		        return super().retrieve(request, *args, **kwargs)
		    # Персонализированная логика для авторизованных
		```
		
		### 2. Производительность изображений
		
		**Оптимизации:**
		- Lazy loading для gallery_images
		- Различные размеры изображений (thumbnail, medium, large)
		- CDN интеграция для быстрой загрузки
		- WebP формат для современных браузеров
		
		### 3. Мониторинг товаров
		
		**Ключевые метрики:**
		- Время загрузки страницы товара
		- Конверсия с детальной страницы в корзину
		- Популярность связанных товаров
		- Bounce rate на страницах товаров
		
		## Пользовательский опыт
		
		### 1. Rich Product Information
		
		**Информационная полнота:**
		- Детальные технические характеристики
		- Множественные изображения с разных ракурсов
		- Полная ценовая информация по роли
		- Навигационный контекст через breadcrumbs
		
		### 2. Персонализация
		
		**Ролевые различия:**
		- B2B: RRP/MSRP, минимальные заказы, оптовые скидки
		- B2C: акционные цены, рекомендации, отзывы
		- Анонимные: базовая информация с призывом к регистрации
		
		### 3. Cross-selling
		
		**Стратегии увеличения продаж:**
		- Релевантные связанные товары
		- Отображение скидок и экономии
		- Подготовка к "Часто покупают вместе"
		
		## Будущие улучшения
		
		### Краткосрочные (следующие 2-4 недели)
		1. Интеграция с Favorites API (статус избранного)
		2. Отзывы и рейтинги товаров
		3. Вариации товаров (размеры, цвета)
		
		### Среднесрочные (1-3 месяца)
		1. Персонализированные рекомендации
		2. Просмотренные товары
		3. Сравнение товаров
		
		### Долгосрочные (3-6 месяцев)

		# Story 2.6: Cart API - Принятые технические решения
		
		**Дата:** 17 августа 2025  
		**Статус:** COMPLETED  
		**Разработчик:** Claude Sonnet 4
		
		## Обзор
		
		Документ описывает ключевые технические и архитектурные решения, принятые при реализации Story 2.6: Cart API с поддержкой гостевых корзин, валидацией товаров и ролевым ценообразованием.
		
		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Гибридная система корзин (авторизованные + гостевые)
		
		**Решение:** Единая архитектура с поддержкой как user_id, так и session_key
		
		**Структура Cart модели:**
		```python
		class Cart(models.Model):
		    user = models.OneToOneField(User, null=True, blank=True)
		    session_key = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        unique_together = [
		            ('user',),  # Один пользователь = одна корзина
		            ('session_key',)  # Одна сессия = одна корзина
		        ]
		```
		
		**Логика определения корзины:**
		```python
		def get_or_create_cart(self, request):
		    if request.user.is_authenticated:
		        cart, created = Cart.objects.get_or_create(user=request.user)
		    else:
		        session_key = request.session.session_key
		        if not session_key:
		            request.session.create()
		            session_key = request.session.session_key
		        cart, created = Cart.objects.get_or_create(session_key=session_key)
		    return cart
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Единообразная работа для всех типов пользователей
		- Возможность миграции гостевой корзины при авторизации
		- Простота frontend интеграции (один API для всех случаев)
		- Соответствие современным UX стандартам e-commerce
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Отдельные модели для гостевых корзин - отклонено из-за дублирования логики
		- Только авторизованные корзины - отклонено из-за UX требований
		- Хранение в cookies/localStorage - отклонено из-за ограничений размера
		
		### 2. Автоматический перенос гостевой корзины
		
		**Решение:** Django сигнал для автоматической миграции при авторизации
		
		**Реализация сигнала:**
		```python
		@receiver(user_logged_in)
		def merge_guest_cart_on_login(sender, request, user, **kwargs):
		    session_key = request.session.session_key
		    if not session_key:
		        return
		    
		    try:
		        guest_cart = Cart.objects.get(session_key=session_key)
		        user_cart, created = Cart.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
		        
		        # Переносим товары из гостевой корзины
		        for guest_item in guest_cart.items.all():
		            user_item, created = CartItem.objects.get_or_create(
		                cart=user_cart,
		                product=guest_item.product,
		                defaults={'quantity': guest_item.quantity}
		            )
		            if not created:
		                # Объединяем количества если товар уже есть
		                user_item.quantity += guest_item.quantity
		                user_item.save()
		        
		        # Удаляем гостевую корзину
		        guest_cart.delete()
		        
		    except Cart.DoesNotExist:
		        pass
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Seamless UX - пользователь не теряет товары при авторизации
		- Автоматический процесс без вмешательства разработчика
		- Правильное объединение товаров при конфликтах
		- Очистка временных данных
		
		### 3. Логика объединения одинаковых товаров (FR6.1)
		
		**Решение:** Автоматическое объединение в CartItemCreateSerializer
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def create(self, validated_data):
		    cart = validated_data['cart']
		    product = validated_data['product']
		    quantity = validated_data['quantity']
		    
		    # Проверяем существующий товар в корзине
		    existing_item = CartItem.objects.filter(
		        cart=cart, 
		        product=product
		    ).first()
		    
		    if existing_item:
		        # Объединяем количества
		        existing_item.quantity += quantity
		        existing_item.save()
		        return existing_item
		    else:
		        # Создаем новый элемент корзины
		        return CartItem.objects.create(**validated_data)
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Соответствие бизнес-требованию FR6.1
		- Упрощение управления корзиной для пользователя
		- Предотвращение дублирования товаров
		- Стандартное поведение для e-commerce
		
		### 4. Comprehensive валидация товаров
		
		**Решение:** Многоуровневая валидация на уровне API и модели
		
		**Валидации реализованы:**
		1. **Существование товара:** проверка Product.objects.get()
		2. **Активность товара:** product.is_active == True
		3. **Наличие на складе:** product.stock_quantity >= requested_quantity
		4. **Минимальное количество:** quantity >= product.min_order_quantity
		
		**Код валидации:**
		```python
		def validate(self, data):
		    product = data['product']
		    quantity = data['quantity']
		    
		    if not product.is_active:
		        raise ValidationError("Товар недоступен для заказа")
		    
		    if product.stock_quantity < quantity:
		        raise ValidationError(
		            f"Недостаточно товара на складе. Доступно: {product.stock_quantity}"
		        )
		    
		    if quantity < product.min_order_quantity:
		        raise ValidationError(
		            f"Минимальное количество для заказа: {product.min_order_quantity}"
		        )
		    
		    return data
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Предотвращение overselling критически важно для бизнеса
		- Раннее обнаружение проблем улучшает UX
		- Соответствие B2B требованиям минимальных заказов
		- API-level валидация защищает от некорректных данных
		
		## Технические решения
		
		### 1. ViewSet архитектура с явным роутингом
		
		**Решение:** Использование отдельных ViewSets с custom URLs
		
		**Структура endpoints:**
		```python
		# Cart ViewSet
		GET    /api/v1/cart/           # Получение корзины
		DELETE /api/v1/cart/clear/     # Очистка корзины
		
		# CartItem ViewSet  
		POST   /api/v1/cart/items/     # Добавление товара
		PATCH  /api/v1/cart/items/{id}/ # Обновление количества
		DELETE /api/v1/cart/items/{id}/ # Удаление товара
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Избежание конфликтов URL patterns с другими apps
		- Четкое разделение ответственности между ViewSets
		- Стандартизация REST API patterns
		- Простота frontend интеграции
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Nested routing через drf-nested-routers - отклонено из-за сложности
		- Functional views - отклонено из-за отсутствия DRF features
		
		### 2. Оптимизация запросов корзины
		
		**Решение:** Comprehensive использование select_related и prefetch_related
		
		**Оптимизированные запросы:**
		```python
		def get_queryset(self):
		    return CartItem.objects.select_related(
		        'product',
		        'product__brand', 
		        'product__category'
		    ).prefetch_related(
		        'product__gallery_images'
		    )
		
		def get_cart_data(self, cart):
		    items = cart.items.select_related(
		        'product', 'product__brand'
		    ).all()
		    
		    # Один запрос для всех данных корзины
		    return {
		        'items': items,
		        'total_items': sum(item.quantity for item in items),
		        'total_amount': sum(item.total_price for item in items)
		    }
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Критическая важность производительности для корзины
		- Избежание N+1 запросов при отображении товаров
		- Масштабируемость для больших корзин
		- Минимизация нагрузки на database
		
		### 3. Ролевое ценообразование в корзине
		
		**Решение:** Интеграция с Product.get_price_for_user() при отображении
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		class CartItemDisplaySerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
		    unit_price = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
		    total_price = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
		    
		    def get_unit_price(self, obj):
		        request = self.context.get('request')
		        user = request.user if request.user.is_authenticated else None
		        return obj.product.get_price_for_user(user)
		    
		    def get_total_price(self, obj):
		        unit_price = self.get_unit_price(obj)
		        return unit_price * obj.quantity
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Единообразие с каталогом и системой ценообразования
		- Автоматическое обновление цен при изменении роли
		- Прозрачность для пользователя
		- Подготовка к созданию заказов с правильными ценами
		
		### 4. Management команды для обслуживания
		
		**Решение:** Cleanup команда для старых гостевых корзин
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		# management/commands/cleanup_guest_carts.py
		class Command(BaseCommand):
		    def add_arguments(self, parser):
		        parser.add_argument('--days', type=int, default=7)
		    
		    def handle(self, *args, **options):
		        cutoff_date = timezone.now() - timedelta(days=options['days'])
		        
		        deleted_count = Cart.objects.filter(
		            user__isnull=True,  # Только гостевые корзины
		            updated_at__lt=cutoff_date
		        ).delete()[0]
		        
		        self.stdout.write(f"Удалено {deleted_count} старых гостевых корзин")
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Предотвращение накопления неиспользуемых данных
		- Регулярная очистка database от временных сессий
		- Соответствие GDPR требованиям
		- Production-ready обслуживание
		
		## Решения по интеграции
		
		### 1. Интеграция с Product API
		
		**Решение:** Полное переиспользование логики товаров
		
		**Интегрированные features:**
		- Ролевое ценообразование через get_price_for_user()
		- Валидация остатков через stock_quantity
		- Обработка изображений через main_image
		- B2B правила через min_order_quantity
		
		**Преимущества:**
		- Единая точка истины для данных товаров
		- Автоматическая синхронизация с изменениями каталога
		- Переиспользование существующих валидаций
		
		### 2. Подготовка к Order API
		
		**Решение:** Структурирование корзины для легкого создания заказов
		
		**Подготовленные данные:**
		```python
		{
		    "items": [
		        {
		            "product": {...},
		            "quantity": 2,
		            "unit_price": "2500.00",  # Актуальная цена по роли
		            "total_price": "5000.00"
		        }
		    ],
		    "total_amount": "5500.00",  # С учетом доставки
		    "total_items": 2
		}
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Простота миграции данных в Order/OrderItem
		- Сохранение актуальных цен на момент заказа
		- Готовность к транзакционному созданию заказов
		
		### 3. Session Management
		
		**Решение:** Автоматическое создание сессий для анонимных пользователей
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def ensure_session(self, request):
		    if not request.session.session_key:
		        request.session.create()
		        request.session.save()
		    return request.session.session_key
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Гарантированная работа гостевых корзин
		- Правильное управление Django сессиями
		- Подготовка к аналитике поведения пользователей
		
		## Решения по тестированию
		
		### 1. Комплексное API тестирование
		
		**Покрытие тестами:**
		- Получение пустой корзины (авторизованные/гости)
		- Добавление товаров с объединением одинаковых
		- Валидация остатков и минимальных количеств
		- Обновление и удаление товаров
		- Очистка корзины
		- Перенос гостевой корзины при авторизации
		
		**Тестовые сценарии:**
		```python
		def test_guest_cart_merge_on_login():
		    # Создаем гостевую корзину
		    guest_client = APIClient()
		    guest_client.post('/api/v1/cart/items/', data)
		    
		    # Авторизуемся
		    guest_client.post('/api/v1/auth/login/', login_data)
		    
		    # Проверяем, что товары перенеслись
		    response = guest_client.get('/api/v1/cart/')
		    assert response.data['total_items'] > 0
		```
		
		### 2. Mock-based unit тесты
		
		**Изоляция зависимостей:**
		```python
		@patch('apps.products.models.Product.get_price_for_user')
		def test_cart_item_total_price_calculation(self, mock_get_price):
		    mock_get_price.return_value = Decimal('2500.00')
		    
		    item = CartItem.objects.create(
		        cart=self.cart,
		        product=self.product, 
		        quantity=2
		    )
		    
		    serializer = CartItemDisplaySerializer(item, context={'request': self.request})
		    assert serializer.data['total_price'] == '5000.00'
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Изоляция тестов от внешних зависимостей
		- Контролируемое тестирование граничных случаев
		- Быстрое выполнение unit тестов
		
		### 3. Integration тестирование
		
		**End-to-end сценарии:**
		- Полный flow: добавление → обновление → удаление
		- Работа с реальными изображениями товаров
		- Интеграция с системой аутентификации
		- Валидация с реальными данными товаров
		
		## Производственные соображения
		
		### 1. Производительность
		
		**Оптимизации:**
		- Минимизация SQL запросов через select_related
		- Эффективные индексы на cart_id и product_id
		- Bulk операции для массовых изменений корзины
		
		**Мониторинг производительности:**
		- Время отклика cart API
		- Количество SQL запросов на операцию
		- Memory usage при больших корзинах
		
		### 2. Масштабируемость
		
		**Архитектурные решения:**
		- Stateless API для горизонтального масштабирования
		- Возможность вынесения корзин в отдельную database
		- Redis кэширование для активных корзин (планируется)
		
		### 3. Безопасность корзин
		
		**Меры безопасности:**
		- Автоматическая фильтрация по пользователю/сессии
		- Валидация всех входных данных
		- Защита от переполнения корзины

		- Анонимные: базовые цены, призыв к регистрации
		
		### 3. Подготовка к покупке
		
		**Pre-checkout features:**
		- Актуальные цены и наличие
		- Расчет предварительной стоимости
		- Валидация перед переходом к оформлению
		
		## Будущие улучшения
		
		### Краткосрочные (следующие 2-4 недели)
		1. Интеграция с Order API для создания заказов
		2. Расчет предварительной стоимости доставки
		3. Сохранение товаров "на потом"
		
		### Среднесрочные (1-3 месяца)
		1. Рекомендации в корзине ("Часто покупают вместе")
		2. Bulk операции (добавление нескольких товаров)
		3. Уведомления об изменении цен в корзине
		
		### Долгосрочные (3-6 месяцев)
		1. Wishlist интеграция
		2. Sharing корзины между пользователями (B2B)
		3. Abandoned cart recovery через email
		
		## Заключение
		
		Story 2.6 создала полнофункциональную систему корзин для FREESPORT:

		## Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1. Транзакционная модель создания заказов
		
		**Решение:** Использование Django `@transaction.atomic` decorator в serializer.create()
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Обеспечивает ACID свойства при создании заказа
		- Автоматический rollback при любой ошибке в процессе
		- Критически важно для e-commerce операций с деньгами
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Ручное управление транзакциями - отклонено из-за сложности
		- Saga pattern - избыточно для данного случая
		
		**Код реализации:**
		```python
		@transaction.atomic
		def create(self, validated_data):
		    # Атомарное создание заказа с очисткой корзины
		```
		
		### 2. Автогенерация номеров заказов
		
		**Решение:** Формат FS-YYMMDD-XXXXX с использованием datetime и uuid
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Читаемый формат для пользователей и поддержки
		- Временная составляющая позволяет быстро определить дату заказа
		- Уникальность гарантируется UUID частью
		- Соответствует брендингу (FS = FREESPORT)
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотренные:**
		- Простой auto-increment - отклонено из-за предсказуемости
		- Только UUID - отклонено из-за нечитаемости
		
		**Код реализации:**
		```python
		@staticmethod
		def generate_order_number():
		    date_part = datetime.now().strftime('%y%m%d')
		    random_part = str(uuid.uuid4().hex)[:5].upper()
		    return f"FS-{date_part}-{random_part}"
		```
		
		### 3. Валидация корзины и складских остатков
		
		**Решение:** Многоуровневая валидация в OrderCreateSerializer.validate()
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Предотвращение overselling критически важно для бизнеса
		- Валидация на уровне API защищает от race conditions
		- Отдельная валидация для B2B минимальных количеств
		
		**Проверки реализованы:**
		1. Существование корзины у пользователя
		2. Непустая корзина (есть товары)
		3. Достаточное количество на складе для каждого товара
		4. Соблюдение минимальных количеств для B2B пользователей
		
		**Код реализации:**
		```python
		def validate(self, data):
		    # 1. Проверка корзины
		    # 2. Валидация остатков
		    # 3. B2B правила минимальных количеств
		```
		
		### 4. Снимок данных товаров
		
		**Решение:** Сохранение product_name и product_sku в OrderItem на момент заказа
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Товары могут изменяться после создания заказа
		- Юридическая важность сохранения точных данных заказа
		- Возможность отображения заказа даже если товар удален
		
		**Поля снимка:**
		- product_name - название товара
		- product_sku - артикул товара
		- unit_price - цена на момент заказа
		- total_price - общая стоимость позиции
		
		### 5. Ролевое ценообразование в заказах
		
		**Решение:** Использование Product.get_price_for_user() при создании OrderItem
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Единообразие с остальной системой ценообразования
		- Автоматическое применение правильных цен по ролям
		- Сохранение цены в снимке предотвращает изменения после заказа
		
		**Поддерживаемые роли:**
		- retail - розничная цена
		- wholesale_level1/2/3 - оптовые цены трех уровней
		- trainer - специальная цена для тренеров
		- federation_rep - цена для представителей федераций
		
		### 6. Расчет стоимости доставки
		
		**Решение:** Статичная таблица соответствия в OrderCreateSerializer
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Простота реализации для MVP
		- Легкость изменения в будущем
		- Отсутствие внешних зависимостей
		
		**Текущие тарифы:**
		```python
		delivery_costs = {
		    'pickup': 0,        # Самовывоз бесплатно
		    'courier': 500,     # Курьер 500₽
		    'post': 300,        # Почта 300₽
		    'transport': 1000,  # Транспортная компания 1000₽
		}
		```
		
		**Планируемое развитие:** Интеграция с API СДЭК для динамического расчета
		
		## Технические решения
		
		### 1. Структура сериализаторов
		
		**Решение:** Разделение на OrderCreateSerializer и OrderDetailSerializer
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Разная логика для создания и отображения
		- OrderCreateSerializer содержит валидацию и бизнес-логику
		- OrderDetailSerializer оптимизирован для чтения с computed properties
		
		### 2. Оптимизация запросов
		
		**Решение:** Использование prefetch_related в OrderViewSet.get_queryset()
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Избежание N+1 запросов при получении заказов с товарами
		- Критично для производительности при большом количестве заказов
		
		**Код реализации:**
		```python
		def get_queryset(self):
		    return Order.objects.filter(user=self.request.user).prefetch_related(
		        'items__product'
		    ).order_by('-created_at')
		```
		
		### 3. Обработка ошибок
		
		**Решение:** Использование ValidationError с детализированными сообщениями
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Понятные сообщения об ошибках для пользователя
		- Возможность локализации в будущем
		- Соответствие стандартам DRF
		
		**Примеры сообщений:**
		- "Корзина пуста"
		- "Недостаточно товара 'Название' на складе. Доступно: X, требуется: Y"
		- "Минимальное количество для заказа товара 'Название': X"
		
		### 4. Computed Properties в модели Order
		
		**Решение:** Добавление calculated полей как @property методов
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Упрощение логики в serializers
		- Переиспользование в других частях системы
		- Сокрытие сложности вычислений
		
		**Реализованные properties:**
		- customer_display_name - отображаемое имя клиента
		- total_items - общее количество товаров
		- subtotal - сумма без доставки и скидок
		- can_be_cancelled - возможность отмены заказа
		
		## Решения по тестированию
		
		### 1. Стратегия тестирования
		
		**Решение:** Разделение на unit и integration тесты
		
		**Unit тесты (11 тестов):**
		- Тестирование моделей изолированно
		- Валидация serializers с mock данными
		- Бизнес-логика без внешних зависимостей
		
		**Integration тесты (9 тестов):**
		- End-to-end сценарии через API
		- Тестирование с реальной базой данных
		- Проверка интеграций между компонентами
		
		### 2. Обработка валидации CartItem
		
		**Проблема:** CartItem model имеет валидацию минимальных количеств, что мешало тестам
		
		**Решение:** Временное изменение товаров для создания CartItem в тестах
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Сохранение существующей валидации CartItem
		- Возможность тестирования edge cases
		- Реалистичность тестовых сценариев
		
		### 3. Тестирование ролевого ценообразования
		
		**Решение:** Создание пользователей с разными ролями в тестах
		
		**Покрытие:**
		- retail пользователи
		- wholesale_level1 пользователи с минимальными количествами
		- Валидация применения правильных цен
		
		## Интеграционные решения

		# Архитектурные и технические решения - Story 2.8: Search API
		
		**Дата принятия решений:** 21 августа 2025  
		**Статус реализации:** COMPLETED - все решения реализованы и протестированы  
		**Story:** [2.8.search-api.md](../stories/2.8.search-api.md)
		
		## Обзор
		
		Данный документ содержит все архитектурные и технические решения, принятые при разработке Search API (Story 2.8) для платформы FREESPORT. Реализован полнотекстовый поиск товаров с поддержкой русского языка, ранжированием по релевантности и интеграцией с существующими фильтрами.
		
		## 1. Архитектурные решения
		
		### 1.1 Database-Agnostic поисковая архитектура
		
		**Решение:** Реализация двухуровневой поисковой архитектуры с PostgreSQL full-text search для production и SQLite fallback для development.
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- PostgreSQL FTS обеспечивает мощный полнотекстовый поиск с морфологией
		- SQLite fallback обеспечивает совместимость в development окружении
		- Автоматическое определение типа БД позволяет seamless переключение
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотрены:**
		- Elasticsearch: избыточно для текущих требований, добавляет сложность инфраструктуры
		- Только PostgreSQL: нарушает совместимость с development на SQLite
		- Только простой поиск: не соответствует требованиям русскоязычного поиска
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def filter_search(self, queryset, name, value):
		    from django.db import connection
		    
		    if connection.vendor == 'postgresql':
		        # PostgreSQL full-text search с русскоязычной конфигурацией
		        search_vector = (
		            SearchVector('name', weight='A', config='russian') +
		            SearchVector('short_description', weight='B', config='russian') +
		            SearchVector('description', weight='C', config='russian') +
		            SearchVector('sku', weight='A', config='russian')
		        )
		        return queryset.annotate(
		            search=search_vector,
		            rank=SearchRank(search_vector, search_query_obj)
		        ).filter(search=search_query_obj).order_by('-rank', '-created_at')
		    else:
		        # SQLite fallback с приоритизацией
		        return results.order_by('-created_at')
		```
		
		### 1.2 Интеграция через django-filter
		
		**Решение:** Расширение существующего ProductFilter через метод filter_search без изменения ViewSet.
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Сохраняет единообразие API - все фильтры работают через один механизм
		- Обеспечивает автоматическое комбинирование search с другими фильтрами
		- Не требует изменений в существующей архитектуре ViewSet
		- Совместимо с DRF пагинацией и ordering
		
		**Альтернативы рассмотрены:**
		- Отдельный SearchViewSet: создает фрагментацию API
		- DRF SearchFilter: недостаточно гибкий для наших требований
		- Custom endpoint: нарушает RESTful принципы
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
		    search = django_filters.CharFilter(
		        method='filter_search',
		        help_text="Полнотекстовый поиск по названию, описанию, артикулу"
		    )
		    
		    def filter_search(self, queryset, name, value):
		        # Реализация поиска
		```
		
		### 1.3 Приоритизация результатов поиска
		
		**Решение:** Трехуровневая система приоритизации с весами полей.
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Пользователи ожидают, что точные совпадения в названии будут выше
		- Артикул имеет высокий приоритет для B2B пользователей
		- Описание имеет низший приоритет как дополнительная информация
		
		**Приоритеты:**
		1. **Название товара (weight='A')** - наивысший приоритет
		2. **Артикул (weight='A')** - равный приоритет с названием
		3. **Краткое описание (weight='B')** - средний приоритет  
		4. **Полное описание (weight='C')** - низший приоритет
		
		**Реализация PostgreSQL:**
		```python
		search_vector = (
		    SearchVector('name', weight='A', config='russian') +
		    SearchVector('short_description', weight='B', config='russian') +
		    SearchVector('description', weight='C', config='russian') +
		    SearchVector('sku', weight='A', config='russian')
		)
		```
		
		## 2. Технические решения
		
		### 2.1 PostgreSQL Full-Text Search Configuration
		
		**Решение:** Использование русскоязычной конфигурации ('russian') для морфологической обработки.
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Поддержка склонений и морфологических форм русских слов
		- Автоматический stemming для лучшего качества поиска
		- Встроенная поддержка в PostgreSQL без дополнительных зависимостей
		
		**Технические детали:**
		- `config='russian'` для SearchVector и SearchQuery
		- `ts_rank` для ранжирования результатов по релевантности
		- GIN индексы для оптимизации производительности
		
		**Пример поискового запроса:**
		```sql
		SELECT *, ts_rank(
		    to_tsvector('russian', name || ' ' || description || ' ' || sku),
		    to_tsquery('russian', 'футбольные')
		) as rank
		FROM products_product 
		WHERE to_tsvector('russian', name || ' ' || description || ' ' || sku) 
		      @@ to_tsquery('russian', 'футбольные')
		ORDER BY rank DESC, created_at DESC;
		```
		
		### 2.2 Валидация и безопасность поисковых запросов
		
		**Решение:** Многоуровневая валидация с защитой от XSS и оптимизацией производительности.
		
		**Уровни валидации:**
		1. **Длина запроса:** 2-100 символов для оптимальной производительности
		2. **XSS защита:** Блокировка HTML тегов `<` и `>`
		3. **Пустые запросы:** Возврат всех товаров для удобства пользователей
		4. **SQL injection:** Автоматическая защита через Django ORM
		
		**Реализация:**
		```python
		def filter_search(self, queryset, name, value):
		    if not value:
		        return queryset
		    
		    search_query = value.strip()
		    if len(search_query) > 100 or '<' in search_query or '>' in search_query:
		        return queryset.none()
		    
		    if len(search_query) < 2:
		        return queryset
		```
		
		**Обоснование решений:**
		- 100 символов - баланс между гибкостью и производительностью
		- Минимум 2 символа предотвращает случайные нажатия
		- XSS защита критична для безопасности
		- Возврат всех товаров при пустом запросе улучшает UX
		
		### 2.3 Оптимизация производительности и индексирование
		
		**Решение:** Создание специализированных индексов для разных типов БД.
		
		**PostgreSQL индексы:**
		```sql
		-- GIN индекс для полнотекстового поиска
		CREATE INDEX products_search_gin_idx ON products_product 
		USING GIN(to_tsvector('russian', 
		COALESCE(name, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(short_description, '') || ' ' || 
		COALESCE(description, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(sku, '')));
		
		-- Составные индексы для комбинирования с фильтрами
		CREATE INDEX products_search_category_idx ON products_product 
		(category_id, is_active) WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
		
		CREATE INDEX products_search_brand_idx ON products_product 
		(brand_id, is_active) WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
		```
		
		**SQLite индексы:**
		```sql
		-- Простые индексы для основных полей
		CREATE INDEX products_search_name_idx ON products_product (name);
		CREATE INDEX products_search_sku_idx ON products_product (sku);
		CREATE INDEX products_search_category_idx ON products_product (category_id, is_active);
		CREATE INDEX products_search_brand_idx ON products_product (brand_id, is_active);
		```
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- GIN индексы оптимальны для full-text search в PostgreSQL
		- Составные индексы ускоряют комбинированные запросы
		- Условие `WHERE name IS NOT NULL` исключает некорректные записи
		- SQLite индексы обеспечивают базовую оптимизацию
		
		## 3. Решения по тестированию
		
		### 3.1 Стратегия тестирования поиска
		
		**Решение:** Трехуровневое тестирование - Unit, Integration, Functional.
		
		**Unit тесты (12 тестов):**
		- Валидация поисковых запросов (пустые, короткие, длинные, XSS)
		- Поиск по разным полям (название, артикул, описание)
		- Регистронезависимый поиск
		- Русскоязычный поиск
		- Приоритизация результатов
		- Исключение неактивных товаров
		
		**Integration тесты (19 тестов):**
		- API endpoints с реальными HTTP запросами
		- Комбинирование search с фильтрами (категория, бренд, цена)
		- Ролевое ценообразование в результатах поиска
		- Пагинация и ordering
		- Performance тестирование
		- Error handling
		
		**Functional тесты:**
		- Демонстрация поиска с реальными данными
		- End-to-end сценарии использования
		- Проверка производительности
		
		### 3.2 Подход к Mock-объектам
		
		**Решение:** Минимальное использование mock-объектов, акцент на реальные данные.
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Unit тесты используют реальные модели Django с тестовой БД
		- Mock только для внешних зависимостей (request объекты)
		- Integration тесты работают с полным API stack
		- Функциональные тесты с реальными HTTP запросами
		
		**Пример тестирования:**
		```python
		def test_search_by_name(self):
		    """Тест поиска по названию товара"""
		    queryset = Product.objects.all()
		    request = Mock()
		    
		    product_filter = ProductFilter(request=request)
		    result = product_filter.filter_search(queryset, 'search', 'Nike')
		    
		    result_names = [p.name for p in result]
		    self.assertIn("Nike Phantom GT2 Elite FG", result_names)
		```
		
		## 4. Интеграционные решения
		
		### 4.1 Интеграция с ролевым ценообразованием
		
		**Решение:** Автоматическое применение ролевых цен в результатах поиска без изменения search логики.
		
		**Обоснование:**
		- Search возвращает QuerySet, который обрабатывается существующими serializers
		- ProductListSerializer автоматически применяет ролевое ценообразование
		- Нет дублирования логики ценообразования
		- Консистентность цен во всех частях API
		
		**Интеграция:**
		```python
		# Search возвращает QuerySet
		search_results = product_filter.filter_search(queryset, 'search', 'Nike')
		
		# Serializer автоматически применяет ролевые цены
		serializer = ProductListSerializer(search_results, many=True, context={'request': request})
		```
		
		### 4.2 Совместимость с существующими фильтрами
		
		**Решение:** Полная интеграция через django-filter FilterSet без конфликтов.
		
		**Преимущества:**
		- Автоматическое комбинирование: `?search=Nike&category_id=1&min_price=1000`
		- Единая система валидации всех параметров
		- Консистентное API поведение
		- Совместимость с DRF пагинацией
		
		**Пример комбинированного запроса:**
		```python
		# GET /api/v1/products/?search=Nike&category_id=1&brand=nike&min_price=5000&max_price=20000
		# Автоматически комбинирует все фильтры
		```
		
		### 4.3 OpenAPI документация
		
		**Решение:** Расширение существующего OpenAPI описания Products ViewSet.
		
		**Обновления документации:**
		```python
		OpenApiParameter(
		    'search', 
		    OpenApiTypes.STR, 
		    description='Полнотекстовый поиск по названию, описанию, артикулу. '
		               'Поддерживает русский язык, ранжирование по релевантности. '
		               'Мин. 2 символа, макс. 100'
		)
		```
		
		**Интеграция в Swagger UI:**

		│                                                                 │
		│  backend:8001 ──► db:5432 (PostgreSQL)                        │
		│              └──► redis:6379 (Кеш и сессии)                   │
		└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
		```
		
		**Сервисы:**
		- **nginx** - Reverse proxy, статические файлы, load balancing
		- **backend** - Django REST API (порт 8001 → 8000)
		- **frontend** - Next.js SSR/SSG приложение (порт 3000)
		- **db** - PostgreSQL 15 база данных (порт 5432)
		- **redis** - Redis кеш и очереди (порт 6379)
		
		### Тестовые сервисы (docker-compose.test.yml)
		
		```
		┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
		│                    Тестовая среда                               │

		│  Отдельная сеть: freesport-test-network                       │
		│  Отдельные порты: 5433, 6380                                  │
		└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
		```
		
		**Ключевые особенности:**
		- Изолированная тестовая среда
		- Отдельные порты для предотвращения конфликтов
		- Оптимизированные настройки для быстрых тестов
		- Временные тома (tmpfs) для ускорения

		## Основные исправления (23.08.2025)
		
		### 🔴 Решенные критические проблемы
		
		#### 1. Противоречие настроек БД
		**Проблема:** test.py использовал SQLite, а docker-compose.test.yml - PostgreSQL
		
		**Решение:**
		```python
		# backend/freesport/settings/test.py
		if os.environ.get('DB_HOST'):
		    # PostgreSQL для Docker тестов
		    DATABASES = {
		        'default': {
		            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
		            'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME', 'freesport_test'),
		            # ...
		        }
		    }
		else:
		    # SQLite для локальных тестов
		    DATABASES = {
		        'default': {
		            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
		            'NAME': ':memory:',
		        }
		    }
		```
		
		#### 2. Отсутствующие сервисы в тестовой среде
		**Проблема:** docker-compose.test.yml не содержал db и redis сервисы
		
		**Решение:** Добавлена полная тестовая среда с:
		- PostgreSQL с оптимизацией для тестов (tmpfs, shm_size)
		- Redis без персистентности (tmpfs)  
		- Изолированная сеть freesport-test-network
		- Отдельные порты (5433, 6380)
		
		#### 3. Отсутствующая nginx конфигурация  
		**Проблема:** Ссылки на несуществующие файлы nginx
		
		**Решение:** Созданы полные конфигурации:
		- `docker/nginx/nginx.conf` - основная конфигурация
		- `docker/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` - виртуальный хост
		
		#### 4. Конфликт портов 8000
		**Проблема:** Конфликт с другими службами на порту 8000
		
		**Решение:** Django сервер теперь доступен на порту 8001:
		- Обновлены все docker-compose файлы
		- Исправлены frontend конфигурации  
		- Обновлена документация и CI/CD
		
		## Конфигурация портов

		SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-testing-only
		DB_HOST=db
		DB_NAME=freesport_test  
		REDIS_URL=redis://:redis123@redis:6379/1
		PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST=1
		```
		
		## Мониторинг и отладка
		
		### Health Checks
		
		Все сервисы имеют health check'и:
		- **PostgreSQL:** `pg_isready`
		- **Redis:** `redis-cli ping`
		- **Django:** `python manage.py check`
		- **Next.js:** HTTP проверка `/api/health`
		
		### Логи и отладка
		
		```bash
		# Логи всех сервисов
		docker-compose logs -f
		
		# Логи конкретного сервиса
		docker-compose logs -f backend
		
		# Shell в контейнере
		docker-compose exec backend bash
		
		# Подключение к БД
		docker-compose exec db psql -U freesport_user -d freesport
		```
		
		### Volumes и данные
		
		```bash
		# Просмотр volumes
		docker volume ls | grep freesport
		
		# Очистка тестовых данных
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --volumes
		
		# Бэкап БД (для разработки)
		docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U freesport_user freesport > backup.sql
		```
		
		## Производительность и оптимизация
		
		### .dockerignore для быстрой сборки
		
		```gitignore
		# backend/.dockerignore
		.pytest_cache
		__pycache__
		*.pyc
		.coverage
		htmlcov/
		node_modules/
		.git
		```
		
		### Кеширование слоев Docker
		
		```dockerfile
		# Копируем зависимости сначала для кеширования
		COPY requirements.txt .
		RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
		
		# Копируем код потом
		COPY . .
		```
		
		### Многостадийная сборка
		
		```dockerfile
		# Стадия сборки зависимостей
		FROM python:3.12-slim as builder
		RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
		COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
		
		# Продакшен стадия
		FROM python:3.12-slim as production
		COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
		```
		
		## Безопасность
		
		### Пользователи контейнеров
		
		```dockerfile
		# Создание непривилегированного пользователя
		RUN groupadd -r freesport && useradd -r -g freesport freesport
		USER freesport
		```
		
		### Настройки Nginx

		### 4. Административные Компоненты (Гибридный подход)
		
		**Архитектура:** Django Admin + кастомные Next.js компоненты
		
		#### Django Admin (Рутинные операции)
		
		- **Управление пользователями:** Базовые CRUD операции с пользователями
		- **Системные настройки:** Конфигурация системы, параметры интеграции
		- **Контент-менеджмент:** Управление статическим контентом, страницы
		
		#### Next.js Custom Admin (Бизнес-логика и дашборды)
		
		#### Дашборд админ-панели (Admin Dashboard)
		
		```typescript
		interface AdminDashboardProps {
		  kpis: KPIData
		  alerts: AlertItem[]
		  integrationStatus: Integration1CStatus
		  systemMetrics: SystemMetrics
		}
		
		interface KPIData {
		  newApplications: number
		  todayOrders: number
		  todayRevenue: number
		  syncStatus: 'active' | 'warning' | 'error'
		}
		
		interface AlertItem {
		  id: string
		  type: 'applications' | 'orders' | 'stock' | 'system'
		  severity: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
		  count: number
		  message: string
		  actionUrl: string
		}
		
		interface Integration1CStatus {
		  circuitBreakerState: 'open' | 'closed' | 'half-open'
		  lastSync: Date
		  lastError?: Date
		  successfulOperations: number
		  syncStatuses: {
		    products: SyncStatus
		    stocks: SyncStatus
		    orders: SyncStatus
		    prices: SyncStatus
		  }
		}
		
		// Компонент KPI карточки:
		┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
		│ 📋 Новых заявок       📦 Заказов сегодня       │
		│ [8] на модерации      [24] +12% к вчера         │
		│ [СМОТРЕТЬ ЗАЯВКИ]     [СМОТРЕТЬ ЗАКАЗЫ]         │
		└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
		```
		
		#### Модерация B2B заявок (Application Moderation)
		
		```typescript
		interface ModerationListProps {
		  applications: B2BApplication[]
		  filters: ModerationFilters
		  onApprove: (id: string, role: UserRole) => void
		  onReject: (id: string, reason: string) => void
		  onFilterChange: (filters: ModerationFilters) => void
		}
		
		interface B2BApplication {
		  id: string
		  submittedAt: Date
		  applicantType: 'wholesale' | 'trainer' | 'federation_rep'
		  contactPerson: string
		  companyName: string
		  phone: string
		  email: string
		  taxId?: string
		  documents: Document[]
		  comment: string
		  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected'
		}
		
		interface ModerationFilters {
		  status: string
		  dateRange: [Date, Date]
		  applicantType: string
		  searchQuery: string
		}
		
		// Статусы заявок:
		const APPLICATION_STATUSES = {
		  pending: { label: 'На модерации', color: '#FF9800', icon: '🟡' },
		  urgent: { label: 'Срочная', color: '#F44336', icon: '🔴' },
		  approved: { label: 'Одобрена', color: '#4CAF50', icon: '🟢' },
		  rejected: { label: 'Отклонена', color: '#757575', icon: '⚫' }
		}
		```
		
		#### Мониторинг интеграции с 1С (1C Integration Monitor)
		
		```typescript
		interface Integration1CMonitorProps {
		  status: CircuitBreakerStatus
		  syncHistory: SyncLogEntry[]
		  onManualSync: (type: SyncType) => void
		  onCircuitBreakerAction: (action: 'open' | 'close' | 'reset') => void
		}
		
		interface CircuitBreakerStatus {
		  state: 'open' | 'closed' | 'half-open'
		  lastFailure?: Date
		  successfulOperations: number
		  failureThreshold: number
		  recoveryTime: number
		}
		
		interface SyncLogEntry {
		  id: string
		  timestamp: Date
		  type: 'products' | 'stocks' | 'orders' | 'prices'
		  status: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning'
		  recordsProcessed: number
		  errorMessage?: string
		  details?: any
		}
		
		// Индикаторы статуса синхронизации:
		const SYNC_STATUSES = {
		  success: { label: 'Синхронизировано', color: '#4CAF50', icon: '✅' },
		  error: { label: 'Ошибка', color: '#F44336', icon: '❌' },
		  warning: { label: 'Предупреждение', color: '#FF9800', icon: '⚠️' },
		  running: { label: 'Выполняется', color: '#2196F3', icon: '🔄' }
		}
		```
		
		#### Разделение ответственности
		
		**Django Admin используется для:**
		
		- CRUD пользователей (базовые операции)
		- Системные настройки и конфигурация
		- Контент-менеджмент статических страниц
		
		**Next.js Custom Admin используется для:**
		
		- Дашборды с KPI метриками и аналитикой
		- Модерация B2B заявок
		- Мониторинг интеграции с 1С (Circuit Breaker)
		- Комплексные бизнес-процессы
		
		**Примечание:** Товары, категории, бренды управляются через интеграцию с 1С и не требуют CRUD интерфейса в админ-панели.
		
		### 5. Специализированные Компоненты

		  onRemove: (id: string) => void
		}
		
		// B2B элемент корзины:

		# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
		
		## **Goals and Background Context**
		
		### **Goals**
		
		* Центральной задачей является запуск B2B-функционала, который предоставит оптовым покупателям, тренерам и представителям спортивных федераций единую точку доступа ко всему ассортименту.   
		* Обеспечить базовый цикл онлайн-продаж: Запустить полностью работающий процесс онлайн-заказов для B2B- и B2C-клиентов.  
		* Создать фундамент IT-инфраструктуры (API-First): Разработать бэкенд, который позволит в будущем легко расширять количество направлений и добавлять новые торговые марки.  
		* В рамках проекта будет создан новый сайт FREESPORT для B2B  
		* Заменить существующие сайты: В рамках проекта будет создан новый сайт для торговой марки BOYBO, интегрированный в разрабатываемую платформу. В дальнейшем это позволит поэтапно перевести пользователей с существующих сайтов на новую единую платформу.  
		* Интегрироваться с базой данных 1С: Реализовать двусторонний обмен данными для синхронизации остатков товаров, цен, выгрузки заказов и обновления их статусов.
		
		### **Background Context**
		
		Существующие сайты компании разрознены и не имеют полноценного функционала интернет-магазина для B2B- и B2C-клиентов. Это мешает централизовать управление продажами, а также добавлять новый функционал. Проект призван решить эту проблему путем создания единой платформы, которая будет служить основой для всех пяти торговых марок и обеспечит полноценный цикл онлайн-продаж.
		
		## **Requirements**
		
		### **Функциональные**
		
		* FR1: Портал должен иметь каталог товаров с многоуровневой структурой.

Дополнительно для всех неРозничных пользователей (оптовики, тренеры, федералы) в карточке товара должны отображаться рекомендуемая розничная цена (RRP - Recommended Retail Price) и максимальная розничная цена (MSRP - Maximum Suggested Retail Price) для информационных целей.  
		* FR6: Должна быть реализована корзина для просмотра, изменения количества и удаления товаров. 
		  * FR6.1: При добавлении товара, который уже есть в корзине, количество должно увеличиваться в существующей позиции (без создания дубликата).
		  * FR6.2: Аналогичная логика применяется при оформлении заказов - один товар может присутствовать в заказе только в одной позиции. 
		* FR7: Должен быть реализован процесс оформления заказа (checkout) на одной или двух страницах с возможностью "быстрого заказа" для розничных покупателей.  
		* FR8: Портал должен иметь базовую административную панель для управления заказами и пользователями.  
		* FR9: Должна быть реализована двусторонняя интеграция с 1С для синхронизации остатков товаров, цен, выгрузки заказов и обновления их статусов.  
		* FR10: Должны быть реализованы следующие роли пользователей: "Оптовый покупатель", "Тренер", "Представитель федерации" и "Розничный покупатель".

		* FR13: На главной странице рекламные баннеры должны показываться для каждой категории клиентов свои.
		* FR14: Мобильная адаптивность должна быть реализована для всех ключевых страниц (каталог, карточка товара, корзина, оформление заказа).
		* FR15: Единая дизайн-система для B2B и B2C интерфейсов для ускорения разработки.
		
		/### **Нефункциональные**
		
		* NFR1: Скорость загрузки страниц не более 3 секунд. Показатель Google PageSpeed Insights \> 70\.  
		* NFR2: Портал должен иметь защиту от XSS, SQL-инъекций, CSRF.  
		* NFR3: Должно использоваться защищенное соединение HTTPS.  
		* NFR4: Архитектура должна быть спроектирована с учетом будущего роста и позволять легко масштабироваться.  
		* NFR5: Портал должен соответствовать ФЗ-152 "О персональных данных".  
		* NFR6: API должен быть документирован с использованием стандарта OpenAPI 3.1 (Swagger) и поддерживать версионирование.  
		* NFR7: Доступ к приватным методам API должен осуществляться через токены (JWT).

		# **Goals and Background Context**
		
		## **Goals**
		
		* Центральной задачей является запуск B2B-функционала, который предоставит оптовым покупателям, тренерам и представителям спортивных федераций единую точку доступа ко всему ассортименту.   
		* Обеспечить базовый цикл онлайн-продаж: Запустить полностью работающий процесс онлайн-заказов для B2B- и B2C-клиентов.  
		* Создать фундамент IT-инфраструктуры (API-First): Разработать бэкенд, который позволит в будущем легко расширять количество направлений и добавлять новые торговые марки.  
		* В рамках проекта будет создан новый сайт FREESPORT для B2B  
		* Заменить существующие сайты: В рамках проекта будет создан новый сайт для торговой марки BOYBO, интегрированный в разрабатываемую платформу. В дальнейшем это позволит поэтапно перевести пользователей с существующих сайтов на новую единую платформу.  
		* Интегрироваться с базой данных 1С: Реализовать двусторонний обмен данными для синхронизации остатков товаров, выгрузки заказов и обновления их статусов.
		
		## **Background Context**
		
		Существующие сайты компании разрознены и не имеют полноценного функционала интернет-магазина для B2B- и B2C-клиентов. Это мешает централизовать управление продажами, а также добавлять новый функционал. Проект призван решить эту проблему путем создания единой платформы, которая будет служить основой для всех пяти торговых марок и обеспечит полноценный цикл онлайн-продаж.</file>

		  redis:
		    image: redis:7-alpine
		    volumes: ["redis_data:/data"]
		```
		
		**Multi-stage Build Strategy:**
		```dockerfile
		# Backend Dockerfile
		FROM python:3.11-slim as base
		FROM base as deps
		FROM base as development  
		FROM base as production
		
		# Frontend Dockerfile
		FROM node:18-alpine as base
		FROM base as deps
		FROM base as development
		FROM base as production
		```
		
		**Production Deployment:**
		- Docker Swarm с load balancing

		- Secrets management
		- Zero-downtime deployments
		
		**Volume Strategy:**
		- **Development:** Bind mounts для hot-reload
		- **Production:** Named volumes для persistence
		- **Backup:** Volume backup strategy для данных
		
		### Testing
		
		**Testing Standards:**
		- Docker testing: Dockerfile best practices validation
		- Container testing: Container structure tests (CST)

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Технический контекст из архитектуры:
		
		**Database Configuration:**
		- **Engine:** PostgreSQL 15+ с поддержкой JSONB
		- **Connection:** DATABASE_URL environment variable
		- **Pool:** Connection pooling для production
		- **Backup:** Automated backup strategy
		
		**Core Models (из архитектуры):**
		```python
		# Основные сущности системы
		class User(AbstractUser):
		    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
		    role = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=USER_ROLES)
		    company_name = models.CharField(max_length=200, blank=True)
		    tax_id = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
		
		class Product(models.Model):
		    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
		    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    brand = models.CharField(max_length=100)
		    price_retail = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
		
		class Order(models.Model):
		    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=ORDER_STATUSES)
		    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		```
		
		**Roles System:**
		```python
		USER_ROLES = [
		    ('retail', 'Розничный покупатель'),
		    ('wholesale_level1', 'Оптовик уровень 1'),
		    ('wholesale_level2', 'Оптовик уровень 2'), 
		    ('wholesale_level3', 'Оптовик уровень 3'),
		    ('trainer', 'Тренер'),
		    ('federation_rep', 'Представитель федерации'),
		]
		```
		
		**Key Relationships:**
		- User → Orders (1:N)
		- User → CartItems (1:N)
		- Product → OrderItems (1:N)
		- Product → Category (N:1)
		- Company → Users (1:N) для B2B
		
		**Performance Indexes:**
		```sql
		-- Поиск товаров
		CREATE INDEX idx_product_search ON products USING GIN(to_tsvector('russian', name));
		-- Фильтрация по категории и цене
		CREATE INDEX idx_product_category_price ON products(category_id, price_retail);
		-- Заказы пользователя
		CREATE INDEX idx_order_user_created ON orders(user_id, created_at DESC);
		```
		
		**Business Constraints:**
		- Цены должны быть положительными
		- Email уникальный для пользователей
		- Остатки товаров не могут быть отрицательными
		- Роли пользователей определяют доступные цены
		
		### Testing
		
		**Testing Standards:**
		- **Model Tests:** pytest-django с фабриками
		- **Migration Tests:** Проверка прямых и обратных миграций
		- **Performance Tests:** Django test utils для query count
		- **Data Integrity:** Constraint validation тесты

		- Валидация model constraints и relationships ✅
		- Тесты миграций (forward/backward) ✅
		- Performance тесты для индексированных запросов ✅
		- Data integrity тесты для business rules ✅
		
		**Реализованная стратегия тестирования:**
		1. **Тестовые фабрики (Factory Boy):** Созданы фабрики для всех моделей с обертками для `.create()` и `.build()`
		2. **Модульные тесты:** 141 тест покрывающий все модели, валидации, связи и бизнес-логику
		3. **Тесты ограничений:** Проверка unique_together, check constraints, foreign keys
		4. **Тесты JSON полей:** Валидация сложных данных в AuditLog и SyncLog
		5. **Тесты computed properties:** Проверка свойств моделей как total_items, calculated_total
		6. **Системные тесты:** Аудит действий, логирование синхронизации, роли пользователей
		7. **Интеграционные тесты:** Проверка взаимодействия между моделями корзины, заказов, товаров

		## QA Results
		
		### Review Date: 2025-01-02
		
		### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)
		
		### Analysis Summary
		Story 2.1 корректно реализует основную функциональность API документации, но имеет пробелы в тестировании:
		
		✅ **Функциональная полнота:**
		- drf-spectacular правильно настроен и интегрирован  
		- Swagger UI доступен по `/api/docs/` с интерактивным интерфейсом
		- ReDoc доступен по `/api/redoc/` с читаемой документацией
		- OpenAPI 3.0 схема автоматически генерируется по `/api/schema/`
		- Конфигурация соответствует архитектурным требованиям (версионирование, серверы)
		
		⚠️ **Проблемы качества:**
		- **Отсутствуют тесты:** Никаких автоматических тестов для проверки доступности endpoints
		- **Ограниченное покрытие:** Документирован только health check endpoint
		- **Нет валидации:** Отсутствуют проверки полноты документации API
		
		✅ **Архитектурное соответствие:**
		- Правильная интеграция с Django REST Framework
		- Соблюдение версионирования API через `/api/v1`
		- Корректные настройки SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS
		
		### Рекомендации для улучшения:
		1. Добавить integration тесты для всех documentation endpoints
		2. Расширить покрытие документацией всех ViewSets через @extend_schema  
		3. Реализовать CI проверки полноты документации
		
		### Gate Status
		
		Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-swagger-documentation.yml
		
		### Обновление от 2025-01-12: Все проблемы решены
		
		**Статус:** PASS ✅ - API документация полностью готова к production
		
		**Решенные проблемы через дочерние истории:**
		- ✅ **Story 2.1.1** - Integration тесты для documentation endpoints готовы
		- ✅ **Story 2.1.2** - Полное покрытие @extend_schema (30+ endpoints) реализовано
		- ✅ **Story 2.1.3** - CI валидация с командой check_api_docs внедрена
		
		**Итоговое состояние:**
		- Swagger UI и ReDoc полностью функциональны
		- Все ViewSets документированы с примерами
		- Автоматические тесты покрывают все documentation endpoints  
		- CI pipeline валидирует полноту документации
		- OpenAPI 3.0 схема генерируется корректно

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Story Context
		**Existing System Integration:**
		- Интегрируется с: Django CMS функционал
		- Технология: Page model с DRF ReadOnlyViewSet
		- Следует паттерну: Django slug-based URL routing
		- Точки касания: Static content delivery, SEO metadata
		
		### Technical Notes
		- **Integration Approach:** Simple Page model с ReadOnlyViewSet
		- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Django slug field с автогенерацией
		- **Key Constraints:** HTML content должен быть безопасным
		
		### Page Model Structure
		```python
		from django.db import models
		from django.utils.text import slugify
		from django.core.validators import RegexValidator
		import bleach
		
		class Page(models.Model):
		    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, verbose_name="Заголовок")
		    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True, max_length=200, verbose_name="URL slug")
		    content = models.TextField(verbose_name="Содержимое")
		    
		    # SEO fields
		    seo_title = models.CharField(max_length=60, blank=True, verbose_name="SEO заголовок")
		    seo_description = models.TextField(max_length=160, blank=True, verbose_name="SEO описание")
		    
		    # Publication
		    is_published = models.BooleanField(default=False, verbose_name="Опубликовано")
		    
		    # Timestamps
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        verbose_name = "Страница"
		        verbose_name_plural = "Страницы"
		        ordering = ['title']
		    
		    def __str__(self):
		        return self.title
		    
		    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
		        # Автогенерация slug если не задан
		        if not self.slug:
		            self.slug = slugify(self.title)
		        
		        # Автогенерация SEO полей
		        if not self.seo_title:
		            self.seo_title = self.title[:60]
		        
		        if not self.seo_description:
		            # Извлекаем первые 160 символов из content без HTML
		            clean_content = bleach.clean(self.content, tags=[], strip=True)
		            self.seo_description = clean_content[:160]
		        
		        # HTML sanitization
		        allowed_tags = ['p', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'a', 'strong', 'em', 'br']
		        allowed_attributes = {'a': ['href', 'title']}
		        self.content = bleach.clean(self.content, tags=allowed_tags, attributes=allowed_attributes)
		        
		        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
		```
		
		### Page API Implementation
		```python
		from rest_framework import viewsets, serializers
		from django.core.cache import cache
		from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator
		from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page
		
		class PageSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
		    class Meta:
		        model = Page
		        fields = ['id', 'title', 'slug', 'content', 'seo_title', 'seo_description', 'updated_at']
		
		class PageViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
		    serializer_class = PageSerializer
		    lookup_field = 'slug'
		    
		    def get_queryset(self):
		        return Page.objects.filter(is_published=True)
		    
		    @method_decorator(cache_page(60 * 60 * 24))  # Cache for 24 hours
		    def retrieve(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		        return super().retrieve(request, *args, **kwargs)
		    
		    def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		        # Cache list of pages
		        cache_key = 'pages_list'
		        cached_result = cache.get(cache_key)
		        
		        if cached_result is None:
		            result = super().list(request, *args, **kwargs)
		            cache.set(cache_key, result.data, 60 * 60 * 24)  # 24 hours
		            return result
		        
		        return Response(cached_result)
		```
		
		### URL Configuration
		```python
		# urls.py
		from django.urls import path, include
		from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
		from .views import PageViewSet
		
		router = DefaultRouter()
		router.register(r'pages', PageViewSet, basename='pages')
		
		urlpatterns = [
		    path('api/v1/', include(router.urls)),
		]
		```
		
		### Cache Invalidation Signal
		```python
		from django.db.models.signals import post_save, post_delete
		from django.dispatch import receiver
		from django.core.cache import cache
		
		@receiver([post_save, post_delete], sender=Page)
		def invalidate_page_cache(sender, instance, **kwargs):
		    # Инвалидация кэша при изменении страницы
		    cache.delete('pages_list')
		    cache.delete(f'page_detail_{instance.slug}')
		```
		
		### Admin Interface
		```python
		from django.contrib import admin
		
		@admin.register(Page)
		class PageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
		    list_display = ['title', 'slug', 'is_published', 'updated_at']
		    list_filter = ['is_published', 'created_at']
		    search_fields = ['title', 'content']
		    prepopulated_fields = {'slug': ('title',)}
		    
		    fieldsets = (
		        ('Основное', {
		            'fields': ('title', 'slug', 'content', 'is_published')
		        }),
		        ('SEO', {
		            'fields': ('seo_title', 'seo_description'),
		            'classes': ('collapse',)
		        }),
		    )
		```

		- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Django related managers для User.addresses.all()
		- **Key Constraints:** Производительность для больших списков избранного
		
		### Models Structure
		```python
		class Address(models.Model):
		    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    address_type = models.CharField(choices=ADDRESS_TYPES)
		    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
		    # ... other fields
		
		class Favorite(models.Model):
		    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		    
		    class Meta:
		        unique_together = ('user', 'product')
		```
		
		### Testing
		- Unit тесты для всех CRUD операций
		- Тестирование permissions и доступа
		- Проверка пагинации для больших списков

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Story Context
		**Existing System Integration:**
		- Интегрируется с: User model, Product model, session framework
		- Технология: DRF ViewSets с custom actions
		- Следует паттерну: Django related models для User.cart
		- Точки касания: Cart/CartItem models, session handling для гостей
		
		### Technical Notes
		- **Integration Approach:** Cart/CartItem models с DRF nested serialization
		- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Django session framework для anonymous users
		- **Key Constraints:** Логика объединения товаров в одной позиции
		
		### Cart Models Structure
		```python
		class Cart(models.Model):
		    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
		    session_key = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
		    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
		    
		    @property
		    def total_items(self):
		        return sum(item.quantity for item in self.items.all())
		    
		    @property
		    def total_price(self):
		        return sum(item.total_price for item in self.items.all())
		
		class CartItem(models.Model):
		    cart = models.ForeignKey(Cart, related_name='items', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=1)
		    added_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		    
		    @property
		    def unit_price(self):
		        # Получаем цену на основе роли пользователя корзины
		        return self.product.get_price_for_user(self.cart.user)
		    
		    @property
		    def total_price(self):
		        return self.unit_price * self.quantity
		    
		    class Meta:
		        unique_together = ('cart', 'product')  # Предотвращает дублирование
		```
		
		### Cart Item Merging Logic
		```python
		def add_to_cart(self, product, quantity):
		    cart_item, created = CartItem.objects.get_or_create(
		        cart=self.cart,
		        product=product,
		        defaults={'quantity': quantity}
		    )
		    
		    if not created:
		        # Объединяем количество если товар уже в корзине
		        cart_item.quantity += quantity
		        cart_item.save()
		    
		    return cart_item
		```
		
		### Testing
		- Unit тесты для Cart/CartItem models
		- Тестирование CRUD операций корзины

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Story Context
		**Existing System Integration:**
		- Интегрируется с: Product model, существующий Products API
		- Технология: PostgreSQL full-text search + DRF filters
		- Следует паттерну: Django Q objects для complex queries
		- Точки касания: Products ViewSet, database indexes
		
		### Technical Notes
		- **Integration Approach:** Расширение существующего ProductFilter через django-filter
		- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Django search with Q() objects и PostgreSQL search vectors
		- **Key Constraints:** Performance для больших каталогов
		
		### PostgreSQL Search Implementation
		```python
		from django.contrib.postgres.search import SearchVector, SearchQuery, SearchRank
		from django.db.models import Q
		
		class ProductSearchFilter(django_filters.BaseInFilter):
		    def filter(self, qs, value):
		        if not value:
		            return qs
		        
		        search_query = value[0] if isinstance(value, list) else value
		        
		        # Защита от XSS и SQL injection
		        if len(search_query) > 100 or '<' in search_query or '>' in search_query:
		            return qs.none()
		        
		        # PostgreSQL full-text search
		        search_vector = SearchVector('name', weight='A', config='russian') + \
		                       SearchVector('description', weight='B', config='russian') + \
		                       SearchVector('sku', weight='A', config='russian')
		        
		        search_query_obj = SearchQuery(search_query, config='russian')
		        
		        return qs.annotate(
		            search=search_vector,
		            rank=SearchRank(search_vector, search_query_obj)
		        ).filter(
		            search=search_query_obj
		        ).order_by('-rank', '-created_at')
		```
		
		### Search Index Migration
		```sql
		-- Создание GIN индекса для полнотекстового поиска
		CREATE INDEX products_search_gin_idx ON products 
		USING GIN(to_tsvector('russian', name || ' ' || description || ' ' || sku));
		
		-- Составной индекс для поиска с фильтрацией
		CREATE INDEX products_search_category_idx ON products(category_id) 
		WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
		```
		
		### DRF Integration
		```python
		class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
		    search = ProductSearchFilter()
		    category_id = django_filters.NumberFilter()
		    brand = django_filters.CharFilter(field_name='brand__slug')
		    min_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(field_name='retail_price', lookup_expr='gte')
		    max_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(field_name='retail_price', lookup_expr='lte')
		    
		    class Meta:
		        model = Product
		        fields = ['search', 'category_id', 'brand', 'min_price', 'max_price']
		
		class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
		    filterset_class = ProductFilter
		    search_fields = []  # Отключаем DRF SearchFilter в пользу custom
		```
		
		### Testing
		- Unit тесты для search functionality
		- Тестирование русскоязычного поиска
		- Performance тесты для больших датасетов
		- Проверка интеграции с фильтрами

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Story Context
		**Existing System Integration:**
		- Интегрируется с: Products API, Product model specifications
		- Технология: django-filter с custom filter classes
		- Следует паттерну: DRF filter backends
		- Точки касания: Product ViewSet, query optimization
		
		### Technical Notes
		- **Integration Approach:** django-filter FilterSet с custom методами для JSON поля
		- **Existing Pattern Reference:** DRF filter backends с чистыми query parameters
		- **Key Constraints:** JSON field поиск должен использовать PostgreSQL индексы
		
		### Custom JSON Filter Implementation
		```python
		import django_filters
		from django.contrib.postgres.fields import JSONField
		from django.db.models import Q
		
		class JSONFieldFilter(django_filters.CharFilter):
		    """
		    Custom filter для поиска в JSON specifications field
		    """
		    def filter(self, qs, value):
		        if not value:
		            return qs
		        
		        # Поиск размера в различных вариантах JSON структуры
		        size_queries = Q()
		        
		        # Вариант 1: {"size": "XL"}
		        size_queries |= Q(specifications__size=value)
		        
		        # Вариант 2: {"sizes": ["M", "L", "XL"]}
		        size_queries |= Q(specifications__sizes__contains=[value])
		        
		        # Вариант 3: {"размер": "XL"} (русский ключ)
		        size_queries |= Q(specifications__размер=value)
		        
		        return qs.filter(size_queries)
		
		class RolePriceFilter(django_filters.RangeFilter):
		    """
		    Custom filter для фильтрации по цене с учетом роли пользователя
		    """
		    def filter(self, qs, value):
		        if not value:
		            return qs
		        
		        user = self.parent.request.user if self.parent.request.user.is_authenticated else None
		        price_field = self.get_price_field_for_user(user)
		        
		        if value.start is not None:
		            qs = qs.filter(**{f'{price_field}__gte': value.start})
		        if value.stop is not None:
		            qs = qs.filter(**{f'{price_field}__lte': value.stop})
		        
		        return qs
		    
		    def get_price_field_for_user(self, user):
		        if not user:
		            return 'retail_price'
		        
		        role_to_field = {
		            'retail': 'retail_price',
		            'wholesale_level1': 'opt1_price',
		            'wholesale_level2': 'opt2_price',
		            'wholesale_level3': 'opt3_price',
		            'trainer': 'trainer_price',
		            'federation_rep': 'federation_price',
		        }
		        return role_to_field.get(user.role, 'retail_price')
		```
		
		### Enhanced ProductFilter
		```python
		class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
		    # Existing filters
		    search = ProductSearchFilter()
		    category_id = django_filters.NumberFilter()
		    
		    # New filters for this story
		    min_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(method='filter_by_price_range')
		    max_price = django_filters.NumberFilter(method='filter_by_price_range')
		    size = JSONFieldFilter(field_name='specifications')
		    in_stock = django_filters.BooleanFilter(method='filter_by_stock')
		    brand = django_filters.CharFilter(field_name='brand__slug', lookup_expr='iexact')
		    
		    class Meta:
		        model = Product
		        fields = ['search', 'category_id', 'min_price', 'max_price', 'size', 'in_stock', 'brand']
		    
		    def filter_by_price_range(self, queryset, name, value):
		        user = self.request.user if self.request.user.is_authenticated else None
		        price_field = self.get_price_field_for_user(user)
		        
		        if name == 'min_price':
		            return queryset.filter(**{f'{price_field}__gte': value})
		        elif name == 'max_price':
		            return queryset.filter(**{f'{price_field}__lte': value})
		        
		        return queryset
		    
		    def filter_by_stock(self, queryset, name, value):
		        if value:
		            return queryset.filter(stock_quantity__gt=0, is_available=True)
		        else:
		            return queryset.filter(Q(stock_quantity=0) | Q(is_available=False))
		```
		
		### Database Indexes for Performance
		```sql
		-- Индекс для фильтрации по цене и наличию
		CREATE INDEX products_price_stock_idx ON products(retail_price, stock_quantity) 
		WHERE is_available = true;
		
		-- GIN индекс для JSON specifications
		CREATE INDEX products_specifications_gin_idx ON products 
		USING GIN(specifications);
		
		-- Составной индекс для brand + price фильтрации
		CREATE INDEX products_brand_price_idx ON products(brand_id, retail_price);
		```
		
		### Testing
		- Unit тесты для каждого типа фильтра
		- Тестирование JSON field поиска
		- Проверка ролевого ценообразования в фильтрах
		- Performance тесты для комбинированных фильтров
		- Валидация edge cases и empty results

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Story Context
		**Stock Management Logic:**
		- Товар "в наличии" если stock_quantity > 0
		- Товар "доступен для заказа" если available_quantity >= minimum_stock
		- available_quantity = stock_quantity - reserved_quantity
		- Резервирование происходит при добавлении в корзину
		
		### Database Schema
		```python
		class Product(models.Model):
		    # ... existing fields
		    stock_quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField('Остаток', default=0)
		    reserved_quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField('Зарезервировано', default=0)
		    minimum_stock = models.PositiveIntegerField('Минимальный остаток', default=1)
		    
		    @property
		    def is_in_stock(self):
		        return self.stock_quantity > 0
		    
		    @property 
		    def can_be_ordered(self):
		        available = self.stock_quantity - self.reserved_quantity
		        return available >= self.minimum_stock
		        
		    @property
		    def available_quantity(self):
		        return max(0, self.stock_quantity - self.reserved_quantity)
		```
		
		### API Response Example
		```json
		{
		  "id": 1,
		  "name": "Nike Air Max",
		  "stock_quantity": 15,
		  "reserved_quantity": 3,
		  "available_quantity": 12,
		  "is_in_stock": true,
		  "can_be_ordered": true,
		  "minimum_stock": 1
		}
		```
		
		### Stock Levels Testing
		```python
		# Test data scenarios
		STOCK_SCENARIOS = {
		    'high_stock': {'stock': 100, 'reserved': 5},      # Много в наличии
		    'medium_stock': {'stock': 10, 'reserved': 2},     # Средний остаток  
		    'low_stock': {'stock': 3, 'reserved': 1},         # Мало остатков
		    'critical_stock': {'stock': 1, 'reserved': 0},    # Критичный остаток
		    'out_of_stock': {'stock': 0, 'reserved': 0},      # Нет в наличии
		    'oversold': {'stock': 5, 'reserved': 10},         # Перепродано
		}
		```
		
		### Dependencies
		- **Depends on:** Story 3.1.3 (test catalog)

		# Story 3.2.3: bidirectional-sync
		
		## Status
		Ready for Development
		
		## Story
		**As a** новый клиент,
		**I want** чтобы моя регистрация на сайте автоматически попадала в 1С,
		**so that** я получаю персональные условия и специальные цены.
		
		## Acceptance Criteria
		
		1. Создана команда `sync_customers_with_1c` для полной синхронизации
		2. При регистрации устанавливается `needs_1c_export=True`
		3. Реализован сервис `export_customer_to_1c()` для отправки данных
		4. После успешного экспорта устанавливается `onec_id` от 1С
		5. Поддержана синхронизация изменений профиля
		6. Реализован класс `CustomerDataMapper` для преобразования форматов
		7. Настроена обработка ошибок экспорта с retry механизмом

		## Dev Notes
		
		### Story Context
		**Bidirectional Sync Flow:**
		1. **Platform → 1C:** Новые регистрации и изменения профилей
		2. **1C → Platform:** Обновления статуса клиента, изменения ролей
		3. **Conflict Resolution:** Автоматическое разрешение конфликтов данных
		
		### CustomerExportService Architecture
		```python
		class CustomerExportService:
		    """Сервис экспорта клиентов в 1С"""
		    
		    def export_customer_to_1c(self, customer):
		        """Экспорт клиента с платформы в 1С"""
		        try:
		            # Подготовка данных для экспорта  
		            export_data = self.prepare_export_data(customer)
		            
		            # Отправка в 1С
		            response = self.send_to_1c(export_data)
		            
		            # Обработка ответа
		            if response.success:
		                self.handle_successful_export(customer, response)
		            else:
		                self.handle_export_error(customer, response)
		                
		        except Exception as e:
		            self.handle_export_exception(customer, e)
		    
		    def prepare_export_data(self, customer):
		        """Подготовка данных клиента для экспорта"""
		        mapper = CustomerDataMapper()
		        return mapper.map_platform_to_1c(customer)
		    
		    def handle_successful_export(self, customer, response):
		        """Обработка успешного экспорта"""
		        customer.onec_id = response.onec_id
		        customer.sync_status = 'synced'
		        customer.needs_1c_export = False
		        customer.last_sync_at = timezone.now()
		        customer.sync_error_message = ''
		        customer.save()
		        
		        # Логирование успеха
		        CustomerSyncLog.objects.create(
		            operation_type='export_to_1c',
		            customer=customer,
		            status='success',
		            details={'onec_id': response.onec_id}
		        )
		```
		
		### Data Mapping Examples
		```python
		class CustomerDataMapper:
		    """Маппинг данных между форматами платформы и 1С"""
		    
		    def map_platform_to_1c(self, customer):
		        """Преобразование данных клиента в формат 1С"""
		        customer_type = 'individual' if not customer.company_name else 'legal_entity'
		        
		        base_data = {
		            'platform_id': customer.id,
		            'email': customer.email,
		            'phone': self.normalize_phone(customer.phone),
		            'customer_type': customer_type,
		            'role': self.map_platform_role_to_1c(customer.role),
		        }
		        
		        if customer_type == 'individual':
		            base_data.update({
		                'first_name': customer.first_name,
		                'last_name': customer.last_name,
		            })
		        else:
		            base_data.update({
		                'company_name': customer.company_name,
		                'tax_id': customer.tax_id,
		                'contact_person': f"{customer.first_name} {customer.last_name}",
		            })
		        
		        return base_data
		    
		    def map_1c_to_platform(self, onec_data):
		        """Преобразование данных из 1С в формат платформы"""
		        return {
		            'email': onec_data.get('email'),
		            'first_name': onec_data.get('first_name'),
		            'last_name': onec_data.get('last_name'),
		            'phone': onec_data.get('phone'),
		            'company_name': onec_data.get('company_name'),
		            'tax_id': onec_data.get('tax_id'),
		            'role': self.map_1c_role_to_platform(onec_data.get('customer_type')),
		            'onec_id': onec_data.get('id'),
		            'created_in_1c': True,
		            'sync_status': 'synced',
		        }
		```
		
		### Celery Task Integration
		```python
		@celery_app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
		def export_customer_task(self, customer_id):
		    """Асинхронный экспорт клиента в 1С"""
		    try:
		        customer = User.objects.get(id=customer_id)
		        export_service = CustomerExportService()
		        export_service.export_customer_to_1c(customer)
		    except User.DoesNotExist:
		        logger.error(f"Customer {customer_id} not found for export")
		    except Exception as exc:
		        logger.error(f"Export failed for customer {customer_id}: {exc}")
		        # Retry with exponential backoff
		        raise self.retry(exc=exc, countdown=60 * (2 ** self.request.retries))
		
		# Trigger export on user registration
		@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
		def trigger_customer_export(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
		    """Триггер экспорта при создании/изменении пользователя"""
		    if instance.needs_1c_export and not instance.created_in_1c:
		        export_customer_task.delay(instance.id)
		```
		
		### Monitoring & Metrics
		```python
		# Метрики для мониторинга синхронизации
		SYNC_METRICS = {
		    'customers_exported_today': lambda: get_customers_exported_today(),
		    'export_success_rate': lambda: calculate_export_success_rate(),
		    'pending_exports_count': lambda: get_pending_exports_count(),
		    'avg_sync_time': lambda: get_average_sync_time(),
		}
		```

		## 🧪 Типы тестов и их назначение
		
		### Unit тесты (tests/unit/)
		**Цель:** Изолированное тестирование отдельных компонентов
		- **Модели**: Валидация полей, методы модели, constraints
		- **Сериализаторы**: Валидация данных, трансформации
		- **Утилиты**: Вспомогательные функции и классы
		- **Сервисы**: Бизнес-логика без внешних зависимостей
		
		**Запуск:**
		```bash
		pytest tests/unit/ -v
		```
		
		### Functional тесты (tests/functional/)
		**Цель:** Тестирование HTTP API endpoints от клиента
		- **HTTP методы**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
		- **Аутентификация**: JWT токены, права доступа
		- **Валидация**: Входные параметры, ответы API
		- **Статус коды**: 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404
		
		**Запуск:**
		```bash
		pytest tests/functional/ -v
		```
		
		### Integration тесты (tests/integration/)
		**Цель:** Тестирование взаимодействия между модулями
		- **Workflow тесты**: Полные пользовательские сценарии
		- **B2B/B2C процессы**: Ролевые различия
		- **Cross-module**: Интеграция между приложениями
		
		**Запуск:**
		```bash
		pytest tests/integration/ -v
		```
		
		### Performance тесты (tests/performance/)
		**Цель:** Тестирование производительности критических операций
		- **Время ответа**: < 3 секунд для страниц
		- **Пропускная способность**: количество RPS
		- **Memory usage**: Потребление памяти
		
		**Запуск:**
		```bash
		pytest tests/performance/ -v -s
		```
		
		## 📋 Соглашения по именованию
		
		### Файлы тестов
		- **Префикс**: Все файлы начинаются с `test_`
		- **Модули**: `test_{app_name}_{component_type}.py`
		- **Примеры**: 
		  - `test_user_models.py`
		  - `test_catalog_api.py`
		  - `test_cart_order_integration.py`
		
		### Классы тестов
		```python
		class TestUserModel:          # Тестирование модели User
		class TestProductAPI:         # Тестирование Product API
		class TestB2BWorkflow:        # Тестирование B2B workflow
		```
		
		### Методы тестов

		```
		
		## 🔧 Конфигурация pytest
		
		### pytest.ini
		```ini
		[tool:pytest]
		DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = freesport.settings.test
		addopts = 
		    --verbose
		    --tb=short
		    --strict-markers
		    --strict-config
		    --cov=apps
		    --cov-report=html
		    --cov-report=term-missing
		    --cov-fail-under=80
		python_files = tests.py test_*.py *_tests.py
		python_classes = Test*
		python_functions = test_*
		testpaths = tests/ apps/
		markers =
		    unit: Unit tests (isolated components)
		    functional: Functional tests (HTTP API)
		    integration: Integration tests (cross-module)
		    performance: Performance tests
		    slow: Slow running tests
		    django_db: Tests requiring database access
		```
		
		### conftest.py (главный)
		```python
		import pytest
		from django.test import Client
		from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
		from rest_framework.test import APIClient
		from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken
		
		User = get_user_model()
		
		@pytest.fixture
		def api_client():
		    """DRF API client для тестирования endpoints"""
		    return APIClient()
		
		@pytest.fixture
		def authenticated_client(api_client, user):
		    """API client с аутентифицированным пользователем"""
		    refresh = RefreshToken.for_user(user)
		    api_client.credentials(HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=f'Bearer {refresh.access_token}')
		    return api_client
		
		@pytest.fixture
		def user():
		    """Базовый пользователь для тестов"""
		    return User.objects.create_user(
		        email='test@example.com',
		        password='testpass123',
		        role='retail'
		    )
		
		@pytest.fixture
		def b2b_user():
		    """B2B пользователь для тестов"""
		    return User.objects.create_user(
		        email='b2b@example.com',
		        password='testpass123',
		        role='wholesale_level1',
		        company_name='Test Company'
		    )
		```
		
		## 🚀 Команды запуска тестов
		
		### Все тесты
		```bash
		pytest
		```
		
		### По типам
		```bash
		# Unit тесты
		pytest tests/unit/ -v
		
		# Functional тесты  
		pytest tests/functional/ -v
		
		# Integration тесты
		pytest tests/integration/ -v
		
		# Performance тесты
		pytest tests/performance/ -v -s
		```
		
		### По маркерам
		```bash
		# Только быстрые тесты
		pytest -m "not slow"
		
		# Только тесты базы данных
		pytest -m django_db
		
		# Конкретный модуль
		pytest tests/functional/test_order_api.py -v
		```
		
		### С покрытием кода
		```bash
		# HTML отчет в htmlcov/
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html
		
		# Отчет в терминале
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
		
		# Минимальное покрытие 80%
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-fail-under=80
		```
		
		## 📊 Метрики качества тестов
		
		### Целевые показатели
		- **Unit тесты**: > 90% покрытие кода
		- **Functional тесты**: 100% покрытие API endpoints
		- **Integration тесты**: Все критические user workflows
		- **Performance тесты**: Базовые бенчмарки
		
		### Обязательное покрытие
		- ✅ Все API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
		- ✅ Все модели Django (создание, валидация, методы)
		- ✅ Все сериализаторы DRF (валидация, трансформации)
		- ✅ Критические бизнес-процессы (заказы, ценообразование)
		- ✅ Аутентификация и авторизация
		- ✅ Ролевые различия B2B/B2C
		
		### Мониторинг качества
		```bash
		# Генерация отчета о покрытии
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html
		open htmlcov/index.html
		
		# Проверка slow тестов
		pytest --durations=10
		
		# Parallel execution для ускорения
		pip install pytest-xdist
		pytest -n auto
		```
		
		## 🔄 CI/CD интеграция
		
		### GitHub Actions
		```yaml
		- name: Run Tests
		  run: |
		    pytest tests/ --cov=apps --cov-report=xml
		    
		- name: Upload Coverage  
		  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
		  with:
		    file: ./coverage.xml
		```
		
		### Pre-commit hooks
		```yaml
		repos:
		  - repo: local
		    hooks:
		      - id: tests
		        name: tests
		        entry: pytest tests/unit/ tests/functional/
		        language: system
		        pass_filenames: false
		        always_run: true
		```
		
		## 📝 Лучшие практики
		
		### Организация тестов
		1. **Один файл = один модуль/компонент**
		2. **Четкое разделение по типам тестов**
		3. **Переиспользование fixtures**
		4. **Параметризованные тесты для множественных сценариев**
		
		### Качество тестов
		1. **Описательные имена тестов**
		2. **Arrange-Act-Assert структура**
		3. **Изоляция тестов (независимость)**
		4. **Тестирование граничных случаев**
		
		### Производительность
		1. **Mock внешние зависимости**
		2. **Использование pytest-django для БД**
		3. **Параллельный запуск тестов**
		4. **Кэширование фикстур**

		### PostgreSQL тестовая БД
		
		```yaml
		# docker-compose.test.yml
		db:
		  image: postgres:15-alpine
		  container_name: freesport-test-db
		  environment:
		    POSTGRES_DB: freesport_test
		    POSTGRES_USER: freesport_user
		    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password123
		  ports:
		    - "5433:5432"  # Избегаем конфликта с основной БД
		  tmpfs:
		    - /tmp         # Ускоряем временные операции
		  shm_size: 256mb  # Больше памяти для PostgreSQL
		  healthcheck:
		    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U freesport_user -d freesport_test"]
		    interval: 10s  # Быстрее проверки
		    timeout: 5s
		    retries: 5
		```
		
		### Redis тестовый кеш
		
		```yaml
		redis:
		  image: redis:7-alpine
		  container_name: freesport-test-redis
		  command: redis-server --appendonly no --save "" --requirepass redis123
		  ports:
		    - "6380:6379"  # Избегаем конфликта с основным Redis
		  tmpfs:
		    - /data        # Всё в памяти для скорости
		  healthcheck:
		    test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "-a", "redis123", "ping"]
		    interval: 10s
		    timeout: 3s
		    retries: 5
		```
		
		### Backend тестовый контейнер
		
		```yaml
		backend:
		  build:
		    context: ./backend
		    dockerfile: Dockerfile.test
		  container_name: freesport-backend-test
		  environment:
		    - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=freesport.settings.test
		    - SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key-for-testing-only
		    - DB_HOST=db
		    - DB_NAME=freesport_test
		    - REDIS_URL=redis://:redis123@redis:6379/1
		    - PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST=1
		    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
		  command: ["pytest", "-v", "--cov=apps", "--cov-report=html", "--cov-report=term"]
		  volumes:
		    - ./backend:/app
		    - test_coverage:/app/htmlcov
		```
		
		## Dockerfile.test оптимизации
		
		### Базовые оптимизации
		
		```dockerfile
		# backend/Dockerfile.test
		FROM python:3.12-slim
		
		# Системные зависимости включая инструменты отладки
		RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
		    libpq-dev \
		    gcc \
		    gettext \
		    git \
		    curl \
		    # Инструменты для отладки в тестовой среде
		    procps \
		    vim-tiny
		
		# Дополнительные тестовые инструменты
		RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
		    pytest-xdist \      # Параллельные тесты
		    pytest-mock \       # Улучшенные моки  
		    pytest-env \        # Environment variables
		    pytest-sugar \      # Красивый вывод
		    pytest-clarity      # Лучшие assert diff'ы
		
		# Директории для тестовых артефактов
		RUN mkdir -p /app/test-reports /app/htmlcov /app/test-logs
		```
		
		### Команды по умолчанию
		
		```dockerfile
		# Команда с оптимальными параметрами
		CMD ["pytest", 
		     "-v",                          # Verbose вывод
		     "--tb=short",                  # Краткие traceback'и  
		     "--cov=apps",                  # Покрытие кода
		     "--cov-report=html",           # HTML отчет
		     "--cov-report=term-missing",   # Terminal отчет
		     "--cov-fail-under=70"]         # Минимальное покрытие
		```
		
		## Настройки Django для тестов
		
		### Адаптивные настройки БД
		
		```python  
		# backend/freesport/settings/test.py
		import os
		
		if os.environ.get('DB_HOST'):
		    # PostgreSQL для Docker тестов
		    DATABASES = {
		        'default': {
		            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
		            'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME', 'freesport_test'),
		            'USER': os.environ.get('DB_USER', 'freesport_user'),
		            'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD', 'password123'),
		            'HOST': os.environ.get('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
		            'PORT': os.environ.get('DB_PORT', '5432'),
		            'TEST': {
		                'NAME': 'test_' + os.environ.get('DB_NAME', 'freesport_test'),
		            },
		        }
		    }
		else:
		    # SQLite для локальных тестов
		    DATABASES = {
		        'default': {
		            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
		            'NAME': ':memory:',
		            'TEST': {
		                'NAME': ':memory:',
		            },
		        }
		    }
		```
		
		### Адаптивные настройки кеша
		
		```python
		if os.environ.get('REDIS_URL'):
		    # Redis кеш для Docker тестов
		    CACHES = {
		        'default': {
		            'BACKEND': 'django_redis.cache.RedisCache',
		            'LOCATION': os.environ.get('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379/1'),
		            'OPTIONS': {
		                'CLIENT_CLASS': 'django_redis.client.DefaultClient',
		            },
		            'KEY_PREFIX': 'freesport_test'
		        }
		    }
		else:
		    # Локальный кеш в памяти
		    CACHES = {
		        'default': {
		            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
		            'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake',
		        }
		    }
		```
		
		## Продвинутые возможности тестирования
		
		### Параллельные тесты с pytest-xdist
		
		```bash
		# В Dockerfile.test или локально
		pytest -n auto  # Авто-определение количества процессов
		pytest -n 4     # 4 параллельных процесса
		```
		
		### Категорированные тесты
		
		```python
		# pytest.ini
		[tool:pytest]
		markers =
		    unit: Unit tests (isolated, fast)
		    integration: Integration tests (database, external services)
		    slow: Slow tests (long-running operations)
		    api: API endpoint tests
		    models: Django model tests
		```
		
		```bash
		# Запуск по категориям
		pytest -m unit                    # Только unit тесты
		pytest -m "integration and not slow"  # Интеграционные, но не медленные
		pytest -m "not slow"             # Всё кроме медленных тестов
		```
		
		### Покрытие кода
		
		```bash
		# Генерация отчетов покрытия
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
		
		# Проверка минимального покрытия
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-fail-under=80
		
		# Покрытие с исключениями
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=.coveragerc
		```
		
		## Скрипты автоматизации
		
		### Windows скрипт (scripts/test.bat)
		
		```batch
		@echo off
		echo [INFO] Запуск тестов FREESPORT Platform в Docker...
		
		:: Остановка предыдущих контейнеров
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes
		
		:: Сборка тестовых образов
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build --no-cache
		
		:: Запуск тестов
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from backend
		
		:: Сохранение кода выхода
		set TEST_EXIT_CODE=%errorlevel%
		
		:: Остановка контейнеров
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
		
		:: Копирование отчетов
		docker run --rm -v freesport_test_coverage:/coverage -v "%cd%":/host alpine cp -r /coverage/. /host/htmlcov/ 2>nul
		
		if %TEST_EXIT_CODE% equ 0 (
		    echo [УСПЕХ] Все тесты прошли успешно!
		) else (
		    echo [ОШИБКА] Тесты завершились с ошибками
		)
		
		exit /b %TEST_EXIT_CODE%
		```
		
		### Linux/macOS скрипт (scripts/test.sh)
		
		```bash
		#!/bin/bash
		set -e
		
		echo "[INFO] Запуск тестов FREESPORT Platform в Docker..."
		
		# Переход в корневую директорию
		cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
		
		# Остановка предыдущих контейнеров
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes
		
		# Сборка и запуск тестов
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from backend
		
		TEST_EXIT_CODE=$?
		
		# Очистка
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
		
		# Копирование отчетов
		docker run --rm -v freesport_test_coverage:/coverage -v "$(pwd)":/host alpine sh -c "cp -r /coverage/. /host/htmlcov/ 2>/dev/null || true"
		
		if [ $TEST_EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ]; then
		    echo "[УСПЕХ] Все тесты прошли успешно!"
		    echo "[INFO] Отчет о покрытии: htmlcov/index.html"
		else
		    echo "[ОШИБКА] Тесты завершились с ошибками"
		fi
		
		exit $TEST_EXIT_CODE
		```
		
		## Makefile команды
		
		```makefile
		# Все тесты
		test:
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from backend
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
		
		# Unit тесты
		test-unit:
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --remove-orphans
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm backend pytest -v -m unit --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
		
		# Интеграционные тесты
		test-integration:
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --remove-orphans
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm backend pytest -v -m integration --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
		
		# Быстрые тесты (без пересборки)
		test-fast:
			docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm backend pytest -v --tb=short
		```
		
		## Мониторинг и отладка тестов
		
		### Логи и вывод
		
		```bash
		# Просмотр логов тестов
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs backend
		
		# Запуск с подробными логами
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build
		
		# Отладка конкретного теста
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm backend pytest -v -s tests/test_specific.py::test_function
		```
		
		### Отладка в интерактивном режиме
		
		```bash
		# Shell в тестовом контейнере
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm backend bash
		
		# Подключение к тестовой БД
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml exec db psql -U freesport_user -d freesport_test
		
		# Проверка Redis
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml exec redis redis-cli -a redis123
		```
		
		### Производительность тестов
		
		```bash
		# Профилирование тестов
		pytest --durations=10         # 10 самых медленных тестов
		pytest --durations=0          # Все тесты с временем
		
		# Параллельное выполнение
		pytest -n auto               # Автоматически по количеству CPU
		pytest -n 4                  # 4 процесса
		
		# Остановка на первой ошибке
		pytest -x                    # Stop on first failure
		pytest --maxfail=3           # Stop after 3 failures
		```
		
		## Интеграция с CI/CD
		
		### GitHub Actions
		
		```yaml
		# .github/workflows/backend-tests.yml
		- name: Запуск тестов в Docker
		  run: |
		    make test
		    
		- name: Загрузка отчетов покрытия
		  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
		  with:
		    name: coverage-reports
		    path: htmlcov/
		```
		
		### Отчеты покрытия кода
		
		```bash
		# Генерация отчетов для CI
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html
		
		# Отправка в Codecov
		codecov -f coverage.xml
		```
		
		## Решение проблем
		
		### Частые проблемы
		
		**1. Контейнеры не останавливаются**
		```bash
		# Принудительная остановка
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down --remove-orphans --volumes
		docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
		docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
		```
		
		**2. Проблемы с портами**
		```bash
		# Проверка занятых портов
		netstat -tulpn | grep :5433
		lsof -i :5433
		
		# Использование других портов
		# Отредактируйте docker-compose.test.yml
		```
		
		**3. Ошибки БД подключения**
		```bash
		# Проверка health check
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml ps
		
		# Логи БД
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs db
		
		# Ручная проверка подключения
		docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml exec db pg_isready -U freesport_user -d freesport_test
		```
		
		**4. Медленные тесты**
		```bash
		# Профилирование
		pytest --durations=10
		
		# Использование tmpfs
		# Уже настроено в docker-compose.test.yml
		
		# Параллельные тесты
		pytest -n auto
		```
		
		**5. Проблемы с покрытием кода**
		```bash
		# Проверка конфигурации покрытия
		cat .coveragerc
		
		# Исключение файлов
		pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing --cov-config=.coveragerc
		```
		
		## Лучшие практики
		
		### Структура тестов
		
		```
		backend/tests/
		├── unit/                  # Быстрые изолированные тесты
		│   ├── test_models.py    # Тесты моделей
		│   ├── test_serializers.py
		│   └── test_utils.py
		├── integration/           # Тесты с БД и внешними сервисами
		│   ├── test_api_views.py
		│   ├── test_database.py
		│   └── test_cache.py
		└── legacy/               # Устаревшие тесты для рефакторинга
		```
		
		### Маркировка тестов
		
		```python
		import pytest
		
		@pytest.mark.unit
		def test_model_creation():
		    """Быстрый unit тест."""
		    pass
		
		@pytest.mark.integration
		@pytest.mark.django_db
		def test_api_endpoint():
		    """Интеграционный тест с БД."""
		    pass
		
		@pytest.mark.slow
		def test_complex_calculation():
		    """Медленный тест."""
		    pass
		```
		
		### Factory Boy для тестовых данных
		
		```python
		# tests/factories.py
		import factory
		from apps.users.models import User
		
		class UserFactory(factory.django.DjangoModelFactory):
		    class Meta:
		        model = User
		    
		    email = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"user{n}@example.com")
		    username = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda obj: obj.email.split('@')[0])
		    is_active = True
		
		# Использование в тестах
		def test_user_creation():
		    user = UserFactory()
		    assert user.email is not None
		```
		
		## Заключение
		
		Docker-based тестирование для FREESPORT Platform обеспечивает:
		
		- ✅ **Изоляцию** - отдельная среда для тестов
		- ✅ **Консистентность** - одинаковая среда везде  
		- ✅ **Скорость** - оптимизация с tmpfs и параллелизм
		- ✅ **Покрытие** - автоматические отчеты покрытия кода
		- ✅ **CI/CD Ready** - готова для автоматизации

		## 🧪 Типы тестов Frontend
		
		### 1. **Unit тесты компонентов** (Jest + React Testing Library)
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование отдельных React компонентов в изоляции
		- **Технология**: Jest + React Testing Library + MSW
		- **Запуск**: `npm test` или `npm run test:watch`
		
		**Пример структуры:**
		```tsx
		// src/components/ui/__tests__/Button.test.tsx
		import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
		import { Button } from '../Button'
		
		describe('Button Component', () => {
		  test('renders button with text', () => {
		    render(<Button>Click me</Button>)
		    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i })).toBeInTheDocument()
		  })
		
		  test('calls onClick handler when clicked', () => {
		    const handleClick = jest.fn()
		    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>)
		    
		    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
		    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
		  })
		})
		```
		
		### 2. **Hook тесты** (React Testing Library)
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование custom React hooks
		- **Технология**: `@testing-library/react-hooks`
		
		**Пример структуры:**
		```tsx
		// src/hooks/__tests__/useAuth.test.ts
		import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react'
		import { useAuth } from '../useAuth'
		
		describe('useAuth Hook', () => {
		  test('should initialize with null user', () => {
		    const { result } = renderHook(() => useAuth())
		    expect(result.current.user).toBeNull()
		  })
		
		  test('should login user', async () => {
		    const { result } = renderHook(() => useAuth())
		    
		    await act(async () => {
		      await result.current.login('test@example.com', 'password')
		    })
		    
		    expect(result.current.user).toBeTruthy()
		  })
		})
		```
		
		### 3. **Integration тесты** (Jest + MSW)
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование взаимодействия компонентов с API
		- **Технология**: Mock Service Worker (MSW) для API mocking
		
		**Пример структуры:**
		```tsx
		// src/services/__tests__/api.test.ts
		import { rest } from 'msw'
		import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
		import { fetchProducts } from '../api'
		
		const server = setupServer(
		  rest.get('/api/products', (req, res, ctx) => {
		    return res(ctx.json([
		      { id: 1, name: 'Test Product', price: 100 }
		    ]))

		    const products = await fetchProducts()
		    expect(products).toHaveLength(1)
		    expect(products[0].name).toBe('Test Product')
		  })
		})
		```
		
		### 4. **E2E тесты** (Playwright)
		- **Назначение**: Тестирование критических пользовательских сценариев
		- **Технология**: Playwright для браузерного тестирования
		- **Запуск**: `npx playwright test`
		
		**Пример структуры:**
		```typescript
		// tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
		import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
		
		test.describe('Authentication Flow', () => {
		  test('user can login and logout', async ({ page }) => {
		    await page.goto('/login')
		    
		    await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'test@example.com')
		    await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password')
		    await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]')
		    
		    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard')
		    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-menu"]')).toBeVisible()
		    
		    await page.click('[data-testid="logout-button"]')
		    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/login')
		  })
		})
		```
		
		## 🔧 Конфигурация Jest
		
		```javascript
		// jest.config.js
		const nextJest = require('next/jest')
		
		const createJestConfig = nextJest({
		  dir: './',
		})
		
		const customJestConfig = {
		  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
		  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
		  moduleNameMapper: {
		    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
		  },
		  collectCoverageFrom: [
		    'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
		    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
		    '!src/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
		    '!src/**/index.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
		  ],
		  coverageThreshold: {
		    global: {
		      branches: 80,
		      functions: 80,
		      lines: 80,
		      statements: 80,
		    },
		  },
		  testPathIgnorePatterns: [
		    '<rootDir>/.next/',
		    '<rootDir>/node_modules/',
		    '<rootDir>/tests/e2e/',
		  ],
		}
		
		module.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)
		```
		
		## 🎭 Настройка тестового окружения
		
		```javascript
		// jest.setup.js
		import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
		import { server } from './src/__mocks__/server'
		
		// Mock Next.js router
		jest.mock('next/router', () => ({
		  useRouter() {
		    return {
		      route: '/',
		      pathname: '/',
		      query: {},
		      asPath: '/',
		      push: jest.fn(),
		      replace: jest.fn(),
		      reload: jest.fn(),
		      back: jest.fn(),
		      prefetch: jest.fn(),
		      beforePopState: jest.fn(),
		      events: {
		        on: jest.fn(),
		        off: jest.fn(),
		        emit: jest.fn(),
		      },
		    }
		  },
		}))
		
		// Setup MSW
		beforeAll(() => server.listen())
		afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
		afterAll(() => server.close())
		
		// Mock IntersectionObserver
		global.IntersectionObserver = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
		  observe: jest.fn(),
		  unobserve: jest.fn(),
		  disconnect: jest.fn(),
		}))
		```
		
		## 🏭 Mock стратегия Frontend
		
		### MSW (Mock Service Worker)
		```typescript
		// src/__mocks__/handlers.ts
		import { rest } from 'msw'
		
		export const handlers = [
		  // Auth endpoints
		  rest.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res, ctx) => {
		    return res(
		      ctx.status(200),
		      ctx.json({
		        user: { id: 1, email: 'test@example.com' },
		        token: 'mock-jwt-token'
		      })
		    )
		  }),
		
		  // Products endpoints
		  rest.get('/api/products', (req, res, ctx) => {
		    return res(
		      ctx.status(200),
		      ctx.json([
		        { id: 1, name: 'Test Product', price: 100 },
		        { id: 2, name: 'Another Product', price: 200 }
		      ])
		    )
		  }),
		
		  // Cart endpoints
		  rest.get('/api/cart', (req, res, ctx) => {
		    return res(
		      ctx.status(200),
		      ctx.json({ items: [], total: 0 })
		    )
		  }),
		]
		```
		
		### Component Mocks
		```typescript
		// __mocks__/next/image.js
		import React from 'react'
		
		const MockedImage = ({ src, alt, ...props }) => {
		  return React.createElement('img', { src, alt, ...props })
		}
		
		export default MockedImage
		```
		
		## 🚀 Команды запуска

		  testDir: './tests/e2e',
		  fullyParallel: true,
		  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
		  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
		  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
		  reporter: 'html',
		  use: {
		    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
		    trace: 'on-first-retry',
		    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
		  },
		  projects: [
		    {
		      name: 'chromium',
		      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
		    },
		    {
		      name: 'firefox',
		      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
		    },
		    {
		      name: 'webkit',
		      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
		    },
		    {
		      name: 'Mobile Chrome',
		      use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
		    },
		  ],
		  webServer: {
		    command: 'npm run dev',
		    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
		    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
		  },
		})
		```
		
		## ⚡ Быстрый старт
		
		### Создание нового unit теста
		1. Создать файл: `src/components/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx`
		2. Использовать шаблон с `render` и `screen`
		3. Запустить: `npm test ComponentName`
		
		### Создание нового E2E теста
		1. Создать файл: `tests/e2e/feature.spec.ts`
		2. Использовать `test` и `expect` из Playwright
		3. Запустить: `npx playwright test feature.spec.ts`
		
		### Добавление нового mock
		1. Добавить handler в `src/__mocks__/handlers.ts`

		This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
		
		## Getting Started
		
		First, run the development server:
		
		```bash
		npm run dev
		# or
		yarn dev
		# or
		pnpm dev
		# or
		bun dev
		```
		
		Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
		
		You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
		
		This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
		
		## Learn More
		
		To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
		
		- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
		- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
		
		You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
		
		## Deploy on Vercel
		
		The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
		
		Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.]]></file>

		## Gemini Added Memories
		- Communicate in Russian.
		
		# **Project Overview**
		
		This is a full-stack e-commerce platform for selling sporting goods, designed as an API-first solution for both B2B and B2C sales. The project is a monorepo with a Django backend and a Next.js frontend.
		
		## **Project Architecture**
		
		* **API-First \+ SSR/SSG Approach:** Ensures SEO optimization and high performance. The decoupling of frontend and backend allows for independent development cycles.  
		* **Next.js Hybrid Rendering:** Utilizes Static Site Generation (SSG) for static pages, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for dynamic content, and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for catalogs.  
		* **BFF (Backend for Frontend) Layer:** Next.js API Routes act as an intermediary layer to aggregate data and enhance security between the client and the main API.  
		* **Monorepo Structure:** Simplifies management of shared components, configurations, and dependencies across the entire platform.
		
		**Technology Stack:**
		
		**Backend:**
		
		* **Framework:** Django 4.2 LTS with Django REST Framework 3.14+  
		* **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ (with table partitioning and JSONB support)  
		* **Cache:** Redis 7.0+ (for caching and sessions)  
		* **Authentication:** JWT tokens with a refresh strategy  
		* **Async Tasks:** Celery with Celery Beat for background jobs and scheduling  
		* **API Documentation:** drf-spectacular for OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification
		
		**Frontend:**
		
		* **Framework:** Next.js 14+ with TypeScript 5.0+  
		* **UI Library:** React 19.1.0  
		* **State Management:** Zustand  
		* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0  
		* **Form Management:** React Hook Form  
		* **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library
		
		**Infrastructure:**
		
		* **Web Server/Proxy:** Nginx (for reverse proxy, SSL, load balancing)  
		* **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose  
		* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
		
		## **Django App Structure**
		
		The project uses a modular Django apps architecture:
		
		* apps/users/: Manages users and a role-based system (7 roles: retail, wholesale\_level1-3, trainer, federation\_rep, admin).  
		* apps/products/: Handles the product catalog, brands, and categories with multi-level pricing.  
		* apps/orders/: Contains the order system supporting both B2B/B2C processes.  
		* apps/cart/: Manages the shopping cart for both authenticated and guest users.  
		* apps/common/: Includes shared utilities, components, and auditing tools.
		
		## **Key Data Models**
		
		* **User Model:** Features a role-based system with 7 distinct user roles, each with different pricing tiers. Includes B2B-specific fields like company\_name and tax\_id.  
		* **Product Model:** Supports multi-level pricing corresponding to user roles. Includes informational prices for B2B (RRP, MSRP), uses a JSONB field for dynamic product specifications, integrates with an ERP via onec\_id, and has computed properties like is\_in\_stock.  
		* **Order Model:** Designed to handle both B2B and B2C workflows, capturing a snapshot of product data at the time of purchase. It integrates with payment systems and includes order statuses with an audit trail.
		
		## **Building and Running**
		
		### **Docker**
		
		The recommended way to run the project is with Docker Compose.
		
		\# Build and start all services in the background  
		docker-compose up \-d \--build
		
		\# Stop and remove all services  
		docker-compose down
		
		The following services will be started:
		
		* db: PostgreSQL database  
		* redis: Redis cache  
		* backend: Django API  
		* frontend: Next.js application  
		* nginx: Nginx reverse proxy
		
		### **Local Development**
		
		**Backend**
		
		1. Navigate to the backend directory.  
		2. Create a virtual environment: python \-m venv venv  
		3. Activate it: source venv/bin/activate (on Windows, use venv\\Scripts\\activate)  
		4. Install dependencies: pip install \-r requirements.txt  
		5. Run the development server: python manage.py runserver 8001  
		6. Run Celery workers (in separate terminals):  
		   celery \-A freesport worker \--loglevel=info  
		   celery \-A freesport beat \--loglevel=info
		
		**Frontend**
		
		1. Navigate to the frontend directory.  
		2. Install dependencies: npm install  
		3. Run the development server: npm run dev
		
		## **Development Conventions**
		
		### **Git Workflow**
		
		* main: Production branch (protected)  
		* develop: Main development branch (protected)  
		* feature/\*: Branches for new features  
		* hotfix/\*: Branches for critical bug fixes
		
		### **Testing Strategy**
		
		The project follows the classic testing pyramid model.
		
		* **Testing Pyramid:** E2E Tests (Playwright) \> Integration Tests (Pytest) \> Unit Tests (Pytest, Jest).  
		* **Backend Structure:** Tests are organized into unit, integration, and legacy directories.  
		* **Pytest Markers:** Tests are marked with @pytest.mark.unit and @pytest.mark.integration for targeted execution.  
		* **Data Generation:** Factory Boy is mandatory for creating realistic test data.  
		* **Coverage Requirements:** Overall coverage must be \>= 70%; critical modules (auth, orders) must be \>= 90%.
		
		**Backend Test Commands**
		
		pytest                \# Run all tests  
		pytest \-m unit        \# Run unit tests only  
		pytest \-m integration \# Run integration tests only  
		pytest \--cov=apps     \# Generate a coverage report
		
		**Frontend Test Commands**
		
		npm test                    \# Run all tests  
		npm test \--watch            \# Run tests in watch mode  
		npm run test:coverage       \# Generate a coverage report
		
		### **Code Style**
		
		**Backend**
		
		* **Formatting:** Black  
		* **Linting:** Flake8  
		* **Import Sorting:** isort  
		* **Type Checking:** mypy
		
		**Frontend**
		
		* **Linting:** ESLint  
		* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
		
		## **Environment and Configuration**
		
		* **Django Settings:** Modular settings files are used for different environments (base.py, development.py, production.py).  
		* **Environment Variables:** Create .env files from .env.example for backend (DATABASE\_URL, SECRET\_KEY) and frontend (NEXT\_PUBLIC\_API\_URL).  
		* **Important Config Files:** pytest.ini, mypy.ini, docker-compose.yml, package.json, jest.config.js.
		
		## **Integrations**
		
		* **ERP (1C):** Two-way data synchronization for products, orders, and stock levels via Celery tasks.  
		* **Payment Gateways:** YuKassa for online payments.  
		* **Shipping Services:** CDEK and Boxberry for delivery cost calculation and logistics.</file>
